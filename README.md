# cosmoglobe-papers

Git respository as a hub for all Cosmoglobe papers for simple version control and ease of use for all involved.



There is an overleaf document (https://www.overleaf.com/9584537818fwvkvdwpmhyt) which can be used to edit the papers directly. You can commit directly to the Github from the overleaf interface.
