%\section{The \Cosmoglobe\ DR2 analysis}
%The current paper is part of the \Cosmoglobe\ DR2 suite, meaning that the $C_II$ modelling is part of a larger global Bayesian end-to-end analysis. In the \Cosmoglobe\ framework, we begin with a an explicit parametric model incorporating all known aspects of the relevant data, including both instrumental effects as well as a physical model of the sky that we observe. For the DIRBE time-ordered data (TOD) used in the DR2 analysis, the parametrization is as follows:
%\begin{align}
%	\label{eq:model}
%    \dv_{\mathrm{dirbe}} &=\G\P\left[\B\sum_{c=1}^{n_{\mathrm{comp}}}\M_c\a_c+\s_{\mathrm{zodi}} +
%          \s_{\mathrm{static}}\right] + \n \\
%                         & \equiv \s^{\mathrm{tot}} + \n \nonumber,
%\end{align}
%
%where $\dv$ is the stacked TODs, $\G$ is an overall gain factor, $\P$ is the
%pointing matrix which projects the physical sky onto a $n_{\mathrm{tod}}$-sized
%space, $\B$ is the instrumental beam convolution operator, and $\n$ is the
%instrumental noise. The physical sky is represented by the next three terms:
%first, a sum over sky components that can be modelled as constant at every
%point in time (in galactic coordinates) -- the sum is over a HEALPix map of
%amplitudes for each sky component ($\a_c$) multiplied by a mixing matrix which
%extrapolates the given component to the frequencies observed; secondly, there
%is a term representing the zodiacal emission, which cannot be treated as a time
%constant; finally there is a term representing a component that is static in
%solar coordinates, which may either be related to the DIRBE sidelobes, or be
%geniune excess radiation originating in the Solar System. These two last terms
%are treated in \citet{CG02_02} and \citet{CG02_03}, and in this paper we are more concerned with the first of the three terms, which can be written more explicitly as follows:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:skymodel}
%\begin{aligned}
%  \sum_{c=1}^{n_{\mathrm{comp}}} \M_c \a_c  = \,
%  &\M_{\mathrm{mbb}}(\bcold,\Tcold,\nuzerocold)\vec{a}_{\mathrm{cold}}
%  && \textrm{(Cold dust)} \\
%  + &\M_{\mathrm{mbb}}(\bhot,\Thot,\nuzerohot)
%  \vec{a}_{\mathrm{hot}} && \textrm{(Hot dust)}\\
%  + &\M_{\mathrm{mbb}}(\bnear,\Tnear,\nuzeronear) \t_{\mathrm{near}}
%  a_{\nu} && \textrm{(Nearby dust)} \\
%  + &\left(\frac{\nuzeroff}{\nu}\right)^2
%  \frac{g_{\mathrm{ff}}(\nu;\Te) }{g_{\mathrm{ff}}(\nuzeroff;\Te)}
%  \vec{t}_{\mathrm{ff}} && \textrm{(Free-free)} \\
%  + &\delta(\nu-\nu_{0,\mathrm{CO}}^i) \t_{\mathrm{CO}}
%  h^{\mathrm{CO}}_{\nu,i} && \textrm{(CO)}\\
%  + &\delta(\nu-\nu_{0,\cii}) \a_{\cii}
%	h^{\cii}_{\nu} && (\cii)\\
%  + &U_{\mathrm{mJy}} \sum_{j=1}^{n_{\mathrm{s}}}
%  f_{\mathit{Gaia},j} a_{\mathrm{s},j}, &\quad&
%  \textrm{(Bright stars)} \\
%  + &U_{\mathrm{mJy}} f_{\mathit{Gaia},j} \a_{\mathrm{fs},j}, &\quad&
%  \textrm{(Faint stars)} \\  
%    + &U_{\mathrm{mJy}} \sum_{j=1}^{n_{\mathrm{e}}}
%  M_{\mathrm{mbb}}(\beta_{\mathrm{e},j},
%  T_{\mathrm{e},j}, \nu_{0,\mathrm{e}})
%  a_{\mathrm{e},j} && \textrm{(FIR sources)}\\
%  + &m_{\nu} && \textrm{(Monopole)}. 
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%
%As it stands, this is as ``complete'' of a static model we currently can write down
%for the frequency domain treated in this paper. The first three
%terms represent the total thermal dust model, which is the subject of \citet{CG02_05}.
%The fourth term models the free-free dust component, which is expected to
%contribute moderately at all relevant frequencies without becoming a dominant
%term. The next term describes the CO line emission, which is here treated as a
%fixed template based on the \citet{dame:2001} CO $J$=$1\rightarrow 0$ map as a
%fixed tracer for all CO emission, and use the line ratios $h_{\nu, i}$
%presented by \citet{planck2014-a12} for modelling the CO at the 100, 217 and
%353 GHz \Planck\ channels.
%
%The other line emission term is the \cii\ line emission term, which is the main
%subject of the current paper. Since the rest frequency of \cii\ is 1900 GHz, it
%is only present in the DIRBE 140 $\mu$m band, in addition to certain FIRAS
%bands (WHICH???). The exact modelling of this component will be explained in
%detail further down (WHERE??)
%
%The three point source terms which follow the \cii\ term are all treated in
%\citet{CG02_04}. Finally, the final term represents the monopole at each
%frequency, which is treated in \citet{CG02_03}.
%
%\subsubsection{Bayesian end-to-end analysis}
%As mentioned, this work is part of a global analysis of data spanning
%100-2.4$\cdot 10^6$ GHz, wherein we draw samples from the \emph{posterior}
%distribution of the full set of parameters that enter the analysis
%\citep{CG02_01} -- in formulaic terms, we are mapping out $P(\theta | \dv)$,
%the probability distribution of the set of parameters $\theta$ given the
%observed data $\dv$. Bayes' theorem allows us to write
%\begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:bayestheorem}
%    P(\theta|\dv) = \frac{P(\dv|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(\dv)},
%\end{equation}
%and, since $P(\dv)$ typically only enters as a normalizing term as long as the
%parameter space does not change, sampling from $P(\theta|\dv)$ is (modulo a
%prior term) is equivalent to sampling from
%$P(\dv|\theta)\equiv\mathcal{L}(\theta)$, the so-called \emph{likelihood}
%function.
%
%The number of parameters involved in our model (Eq. \ref{eq:model}) is of the
%order of millions, making sampling from the likelihood function a non-trivial
%task. The \Cosmoglobe\ framework is based on the \commander software
%\citep{eriksen:2004,seljebotn:2019,bp03}, which maps out the posterior
%parameter distribution through a process called \emph{Gibbs sampling}
%\citep[e.g.,][]{geman:1984}, a Monte-Carlo method based on sequentially
%sampling each parameter (or a subset of parameters) from their respective
%marginal distributions wrt. all other parameters. The theory of Gibbs sampling
%then says that by combining these samples into a full set for all the
%parameters involved, this set will represent a proper sample from the joint
%distribution. Applied to Eq. \ref{eq:model}, we get a sequence of operations as
%follows:
%
%\begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:gibbschain}
%\begin{aligned}
%\G &\,\leftarrow P(\G&\,\mid &\,\dv,&\, &\,\phantom{\G} &\,\xi_n, &
%\,\beta_{\mathrm{sky}}& \,\a_{\mathrm{sky}}, &\,\zeta_{\mathrm{z}},
%&\,\a_{\mathrm{static}})\\
%\xi_{\mathrm{n}} &\,\leftarrow P(\xi_{\mathrm{n}}&\,\mid &\,\dv,&\, &\,\G, &\,\phantom{\xi_n} &
%\,\beta_{\mathrm{sky}}& \,\a_{\mathrm{sky}}, &\,\zeta_{\mathrm{z}},
%&\,\a_{\mathrm{static}})\\
%\beta_{\mathrm{sky}} &\,\leftarrow P(\beta_{\mathrm{sky}}&\,\mid &\,\dv,&\, &\,\G, &\,\xi_n, &
%\,\phantom{\beta_{\mathrm{sky}}}& \,\a_{\mathrm{sky}}, &\,\zeta_{\mathrm{z}}, &\,\a_{\mathrm{static}})\\
%\a_{\mathrm{sky}} &\,\leftarrow P(\a_{\mathrm{sky}}&\,\mid &\,\dv,&\, &\,\G, &\,\xi_n, &
%\,\beta_{\mathrm{sky}},& \,\phantom{\a_{\mathrm{sky}},}
%&\,\zeta_{\mathrm{z}}, &\,\a_{\mathrm{static}})\\
%\zeta_{\mathrm{z}} &\,\leftarrow P(\zeta_{\mathrm{z}}&\,\mid &\,\dv,&\, &\,\G, &\,\xi_n, &
%\,\beta_{\mathrm{sky}},& \,\a_{\mathrm{sky}},
%&\,\phantom{\zeta_{\mathrm{z}},} &\,\a_{\mathrm{static}})\\
%\a_{\mathrm{static}} &\,\leftarrow P(\a_{\mathrm{static}}&\,\mid &\,\dv,&\, &\,\G, &\,\xi_n, &
%\,\beta_{\mathrm{sky}},& \,\a_{\mathrm{sky}}, &\,\zeta_{\mathrm{z}} &\,\phantom{\a_{\mathrm{static}}})
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%
%Here, the symbol $\leftarrow$ indicates the operation of drawing a sample from
%the distribution on the right-hand side. After some burn-in period, the
%resulting joint parameter sets will correspond to samples drawn from the true
%underlying joint posterior.
%
%Since every step of the Gibbs sampling process assumes that all other
%parameters are ``given'', we can now treat a highly interconnected problem
%(i.e. sampling from the joint posterior of all parameters involved in our data
%model) as a highly modular one -- meaning that we can perform each
%``sub-analysis'' without being concerned with the other parts of the problem.
%Hence, in this paper, we mainly focus on the three first components of Eq.
%(\ref{eq:skymodel}), and leave the other components for other papers. (TODO
%maybe actually cite those papers)


\section{Methodology}
This paper is part of the \Cosmoglobe\ DR2 analysis, and we use the same
end-to-end framework as described in \citep{CG02_01}. This framework is based
on the theory of Gibbs sampling, wherein a joint probablity distribution can be
sampled from by sampling from all of its conditional distribution; that is,
given a joint distribution $P(\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b}, \mathrm{c}, ...)$ we can
sample from this indirectly by sampling from the distributions
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
P(\mathrm{a} \mid \mathrm{b}, \mathrm{c}, ...) \\
P(\mathrm{b} \mid \mathrm{a}, \mathrm{c}, ...) \\
P(\mathrm{c} \mid \mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b}, ...) \\
\cdots
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
in sequence. Considered together, this sequence of samples will, according to
the theory of Gibbs sampling, be a sample from the original joint distribution.

In the \Cosmoglobe\ context, the joint probability distribution function we
sample from is the Bayesian \emph{posterior} distribution
\begin{equation}
    P(\mathbf{\theta} | \mathbf{d}) =
    \frac{P(\mathbf{d}|\mathbf{\theta})P(\mathbf{\theta})}{P(\mathbf{d})},
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ represents all parameters characterizing both the sky we are
observing as well as the instruments observing that sky, and $\mathbf{d}$
represents the data we have gathered using those instruments.

The parameters represented by $\theta$ will depend on both which wavelengths of
the sky we are observing, which instruments we are using, and at which
``aggregate'' level we are using the data from those instruments (i.e. whether
they are raw data or already processed in some way). The \Cosmoglobe\ DR2
analysis is, as an example, using raw time ordered data (TOD) from the DIRBE
bands (described further in section \ref{sec:dataselection}), and a general
data model for these bands can be written
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:model}
    \dv_{\mathrm{dirbe}} &=\G\P\left[\B\sum_{c=1}^{n_{\mathrm{comp}}}\M_c\a_c+\s_{\mathrm{zodi}} +
          \s_{\mathrm{static}}\right] + \n \\
                         & \equiv \s^{\mathrm{tot}} + \n \nonumber,
\end{align}
where $\dv$ is the stacked TODs, $\G$ is an overall gain factor, $\P$ is the
pointing matrix which projects the physical sky onto a $n_{\mathrm{tod}}$-sized
space, $\B$ is the instrumental beam convolution operator, and $\n$ is the
instrumental noise. The physical sky is represented by the next three terms:
first, a sum over sky components that can be modelled as constant at every
point in time (in galactic coordinates) -- the sum is over a HEALPix map of
amplitudes for each sky component ($\a_c$) multiplied by a mixing matrix which
extrapolates the given component to the frequencies observed; secondly, there
is a term representing the zodiacal emission, which cannot be treated as
constant in time; finally there is a term representing a component that is
static in solar coordinates, which may either be related to the DIRBE
sidelobes, or be geniune excess radiation originating in the Solar System.

For the general DR2 analysis, the first term in the parenthesis on the right
hand side may be written more explicitly as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:skymodel}
\begin{aligned}
  \sum_{c=1}^{n_{\mathrm{comp}}} \M_c \a_c  = \,
  &\M_{\mathrm{mbb}}(\bcold,\Tcold,\nuzerocold)\vec{a}_{\mathrm{cold}}
  && \textrm{(Cold dust)} \\
  + &\M_{\mathrm{mbb}}(\bhot,\Thot,\nuzerohot)
  \vec{a}_{\mathrm{hot}} && \textrm{(Hot dust)}\\
  + &\M_{\mathrm{mbb}}(\bnear,\Tnear,\nuzeronear) \t_{\mathrm{near}}
  a_{\nu} && \textrm{(Nearby dust)} \\
  + &\left(\frac{\nuzeroff}{\nu}\right)^2
  \frac{g_{\mathrm{ff}}(\nu;\Te) }{g_{\mathrm{ff}}(\nuzeroff;\Te)}
  \vec{t}_{\mathrm{ff}} && \textrm{(Free-free)} \\
  + &\delta(\nu-\nu_{0,\mathrm{CO}}^i) \t_{\mathrm{CO}}
  h^{\mathrm{CO}}_{\nu,i} && \textrm{(CO)}\\
  + &\delta(\nu-\nu_{0,\cii}) \a_{\cii}
	h^{\cii}_{\nu} && (\cii)\\
  + &U_{\mathrm{mJy}} \sum_{j=1}^{n_{\mathrm{s}}}
  f_{\mathit{Gaia},j} a_{\mathrm{s},j}, &\quad&
  \textrm{(Bright stars)} \\
  + &U_{\mathrm{mJy}} f_{\mathit{Gaia},j} \a_{\mathrm{fs},j}, &\quad&
  \textrm{(Faint stars)} \\  
    + &U_{\mathrm{mJy}} \sum_{j=1}^{n_{\mathrm{e}}}
  M_{\mathrm{mbb}}(\beta_{\mathrm{e},j},
  T_{\mathrm{e},j}, \nu_{0,\mathrm{e}})
  a_{\mathrm{e},j} && \textrm{(FIR sources)}\\
  + &m_{\nu} && \textrm{(Monopole)}. 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
These terms represent the known static components that contribute to the 1-10
DIRBE bands, and describe, in order, the thermal dust component (first three
terms), the free-free component, the CO component, the \cii\ component, three
point source terms, and and overall band monopole term.

The \commanderthree\ software \citep{eriksen:2004,seljebotn:2019,bp03} is what
actually performs the Gibbs sampling describes above, and another way to
describe this kind of analysis is as a global \emph{iterative} analysis, where
we allow the sky model to inform the instrument parameter classification, and
then in turn allow the updated instrument information to inform the sky model,
and so on. This process is repeated hundreds of times, and each iteration
yields a new sample from the posterior distribution of the data model
parameters given the observed data.

In the main DR2 paper \citep{CG02_01}, a comprehensive analysis of all ten
DIRBE bands is carried out, combined with data from FIRAS, star catalogue data
from GAIA and WISE, as well as \Planck\ \hfi\ frequency maps. In this paper,
however, we are performing a more focused and limited analysis, the main
difference being that we here only use the 9th DIRBE band (central wavelength
140 $\mu$m), and certain FIRAS bands (described in section
\ref{sec:dataselection}), in addition to the \Planck\ \hfi\ data.

The reason for this focused analysis is the very limited extend to which the
\cii\ component affects the other sky components: Any changes in the \cii\
component will only affect the channels observing at approximately 1900 GHz,
and the only other components present at these frequencies are the thermal dust
and zodiacal light components. Thus, we here operate with a greatly simplified
static sky model compared to Eq. (\ref{eq:skymodel}), where we only keep the
thermal dust and \cii\ terms. We also keep the $\s_{zodi}$ term from Eq.
\ref{eq:model}, but we allow only the overall emissivity of this component to
be a free parameter, with the rest of the model being fixed to the model from
\citet{CG02_02}.

\section{The sky model}
Here, we describe the treatment of the sky components that are included in the
analysis in further detail.

\label{sec:skymodel}
\subsection{\cii}
The galactic CII emission originates in star forming regions in the
galaxy, and is thus used as a tracer for such regions. In Fig.
\ref{fig:cii_firas} we display the CII map as measured by the COBE-FIRAS
experiment\citep{fixsen:1994,mather:1999}, which shows the large-scale
morphology of this component in the Milky Way.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/init_CII_firas_n16_v20.pdf}
    \caption{The CII amplitude map as observed by FIRAS.}
    \label{fig:cii_firas}
\end{figure}

The \cii\ line emission component has a rest frequency of 1900 GHz, and as such
is expected to be present in the 140 $\mu$m 9th band out of all the DIRBE bands. In
this work, we model the \cii\ emission as an amplitude map defined on a HEALPix
\citep{HEALPIX} \nside$=512$ grid. For each band at which the \cii\ component
is expected to contribute (in this analysis, the DIRBE 09a and 09b bands, as
well as the FIRAS bands between 1809 and 2081 GHz), we model the \cii\
contribution as
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{band}} = \mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{ref}} \cdot
    r_{\mathrm{band}},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{ref}}$ is the reference \cii\ amplitude map, and
$r_{\mathrm{band}}$ is a band-specific line ratio, measuring the relative
contribution of \cii\ to that specific band.


\subsection{Thermal dust}
The thermal dust emission modelled in the same way as in the DR2 thermal dust
analysis paper \citep{CG02_05}, which models the dust using three components,
each of which is 
\subsection{Zodiacal light}

\section{Data selection and cleaning}
\label{sec:dataselection}

The general description of the data used in the DR2 analysis is detailed in
\citet{CG02_01}. An important feature of a global analysis like the one this
paper is based on is that although there is data involved in the analysis that
does not directly impact the object of study (in this case, the \cii\
component), all the data does in one way or another impact the overall sky
model, which in turn affects the quality of the \cii\ component fit.

We will here first describe the data that directly impacts the \cii\ fit,
before describing the rest of the data used in the total analysis.

\subsection{DIRBE 140 $\mu$m}
The Diffuse InfraRed Explorer (DIRBE), whose main goal was the mapping out of the
CIB, was part of the \COBE\ satellite \citep{boggess92, silverberg93}, and
measured the sky in ten frequency bands from $1\,\mathrm{\mu}$m to
$240\,\mathrm{\mu}$m. In the \Cosmoglobe\ DR2 analysis, we have converted the
original DIRBE CIO (Calibrated Individual Observations), whose pointing
information is given in terms of Quadcube pixels with a resolution of 20\arcs
into a HEALPix \nside=512 pixelation, giving an approximate resolution of
7\arcm. Following the nomenclature of \citet{CG02_01}, we refer to the DIRBE
CIOs as ``time-ordered data'' (TOD).

In the current paper, the DIRBE wavelength band of most interest is the 140
$\mu$m one (from here on called band 9 keeping with DIRBE terminology); the
\cii\ line has a rest frequency of 1900 GHz (158 $\mu$m), which is close to the
peak of the band 9 bandpass response curve (see Fig. \ref{fig:140_bp}).

\subsection{FIRAS}
The \COBE-FIRAS experiment was an absolutely calibrated differential Michelson
Fourier transform interferometer that observed the full sky from
68\,GHz--2911\,GHz with 13.6\,GHz frequency resolution
\citep{fixsen:1994,mather:1999}. 

Although the main goal of FIRAS was the characterization of the CMB blackbody
spectrum \citep{mather:1994}, it is also a very important dataset in the
determination of emission lines such as \cii, because of its high resolution in
frequency space.

In the DR2 analysis, we are using only a subset of the FIRAS frequency bands,
listed in \citet{CG02_01}; their usage serves two main purposes: First, since
FIRAS was absolutely calibrator, it is an important check on the calibration of
other data sets -- here, we use it to contribute to the calibration of the
\hfi\ bands, as well as the 100, 140 and 240 $\mu$m DIRBE bands. Second, as
mentioned above, the high frequency resolution of DIRBE means that it is
effective in constraining the \cii\ line: By comparing the observed sky at
DIRBE band 9 with the FIRAS data roughly around this wavelength, we can see
what part of the band 9 radiation which is coming from \cii\ line emission.
Thus, the most important FIRAS bands for the present paper are the ones between
1809-2081 GHz, which are used for the \cii\ constraints, as well as the 2135
GHz one, which is used to assist in the calibration of DIRBE band 9, which in
turn provides a check on the overall scaling of the resulting \cii\ maps.

\subsection{Other data sets}
As mentioned above, the global analysis of which this paper is a part includes
several data sets in order to help constrain the sky model at the frequencies
we are considering. In addition to the DIRBE and FIRAS bands not directly
impacting this paper, there are two other data sets which are used, which will
briefly be mentioned here.

\subsubsection{\Planck\ HFI}
The \Planck\ High Frequency Instrument (HFI; \citealt{planck2016-l03}) observed
the sky in six frequency channels from 100 GHz to 857 GHz, with the primary
purpose being characterizing temperature fluctuations in the CMB to
unprecedentedly small scales. As it also was able to target the far-infrared
sky, it is able to shed light on the dust component in this frequency range.

The importance of HFI for this paper is thus in its ability to constrain the
dust SED and morphology at lower frequencies, which impacts the modelling of
dust at DIRBE band 9 and thus indirectly impacts the quality of the \cii\ maps.

\subsubsection{\Gaia}
The \Gaia\ DR2 \citep{gaia:2016,gaia:2018} and \WISE \citep{wright:2010}
datasets are used to fit point sources that are found in the near-infrared sky.
The impact of such point sources on the \cii\ modelling is expected to be
relatively small, as there are few point sources visiable in the ninth DIRBE
band.

\section{Astrophysical results}

In what follows, all chains are thinned such that every other sample is
discarded. All aggregate computations (such as means, standard deviations,
etc) were in addition computed only from the last half of the chain, to avoid
burn-in effects. Thus, such calculations are based on 250 samples from the last
half of the chain.

The mean Cosmoglobe DR2 \cii\ map is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cii_mean}, and the
standard deviation in Fig. \ref{fig:cii_std}. The \CII\ amplitude maps exhibit
good mixing behavior, as evidenced in Fig. \ref{fig:traceplots_cii_amps}, where
we show the traceplots of the amplitudes of three randomly selected pixels. We
also show typical residuals from a sample in the end of the chain (sample 700)
in Figs. \ref{fig:firas_1904_res} and \ref{fig:firas_1890_res}.

We show the 09 DIRBE band gain traceplots in \ref{fig:traceplots_cii_gains},
and the traceplots of the 09 DIRBE band + 1904 FIRAS band \cii\ line ratios. As
evident (and expected), the line ratios and gains at the 09 bands are
anticorrelated with each other. In addition, because we fix the gains

We also plot the dust SED parameters at band 09 in
Figs.\ref{fig:traceplots_dust_seds_colddust}-\ref{fig:traceplots_dust_sed_slopes_nearbydust}.
Both the SED amplitudes themselves, as well as the SED slopes, are plotted.
