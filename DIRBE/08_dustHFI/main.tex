   \abstract{
     We present a four-component high-resolution model of thermal dust emission for microwave and infrared frequencies derived from \Planck\ HFI, WHAM and Gaia. This model is inspired by a joint low-resolution template-based analysis of \Planck\ HFI and COBE-DIRBE data presented in a companion paper, and the resulting high-resolution model forms the basis for the thermal dust model employed in the Cosmoglobe DR2 reanalysis of \COBE-DIRBE. The four dust components corresponds to different semi-independent physical effects, referred to as ``cold dust'', ``hot dust'',  ``nearby dust'', and ``H$\alpha$ correlated dust''. The H$\alpha$ dust is a dust extinction component, and has a negative amplitude in the \Planck\ HFI bands. The spatial distributions of the nearby dust and H$\alpha$ dust components are defined by a Gaia 3D extinction model \citep{edenhofer:2024} and the Wisconsin H-$\alpha$ mapper (WHAM; \citealp{wham:2003}), respectively, while the hot and cold dust components are fit freely pixel-by-pixel to the \Planck\ HFI data. The spectral energy densities (SEDs) of all four components are modelled in terms of modified blackbody (MBB) spectra with a free global temperature, $T$, and spectral index, $\beta$, both of which are fitted globally across the sky. Thus, this dust model has ten global sky parameters (two SED parameters for each dust component plus two global template amplitude parameters) and two amplitudes per pixel, one each for the hot and cold dust; in contrast, previous \Planck\ HFI dust models have typically assumed spatially varying MBB temperatures and spectral indices, resulting in three degrees of freedom per pixel. We use a parameter grid search (for global parameters) coupled to a Bayesian Gibbs sampler (for per-pixel parameters) to fit this model to \planck\ HFI data. The best-fit MBB temperature for the hot and cold dust components are $T_{\mathrm{h}} = 30\pm3\,\mathrm{K}$ and $T_{\mathrm{c}} = 11\pm3\,\mathrm{K}$, and the corresponding best-fit spectral indices are $\beta_{\mathrm{h}}=1.75\pm0.20$ and $\beta_{\mathrm{c}}=1.85\pm0.20$, respectively. In agreement with the low-resolution template fit analysis of \citet{CG02_05}, we find that the hot dust component is spatially strongly correlated with the FIRAS \ion{C}{II} map, while the cold dust component is strongly correlated with the HI4PI \ion{H}{I} and the Dame et al.\ CO $J=1$-0 surveys. Despite its fewer degrees of freedom per pixel compared to the official \Planck\ analysis, we find that this new model performs competitively in terms of overall residuals, capturing between 98.5 and 99.9\,\% of the full-sky dust rms for all channels between 100 and 857\,GHz. When fitting a spatially varying 3-parameter MBB model to the new four-component dust model with isotropic SEDs, we find very similar spatial distributions of $T$ and $\beta$ as in the official \Planck\ analysis. We conclude that this new model represents both a statistically more efficient summary of thermal dust in the microwave and far-infrared regimes, as well as a physically more realistic decomposition than the traditional 3-parameter MBB model, due to its strong correlations with well-defined \ion{C}{II}, \ion{H}{I}, and CO line emission tracers. Finally, we expect that the novel templates of hot and cold dust emission presented in this paper may form a key component in future temperature and polarization measurements for future projects such as Simons Observatory and LiteBIRD, where high-precision measurements of the dust will be critical for constraining $B$-mode CMB polarization. 
%     and find a strong correlation between the hot dust and singly-ionized-carbon (\ion{C}{II}) emission and the cold dust and the neutral hydrogen emission. It has long been known that the cold dust correlates with the neutral hydrogen emission, however the correlation between hot dust and \ion{C}{II} emission is an exciting development. Since \ion{C}{II} emission is expected in hotter regions of the Milky Way galaxy this is potentially an expected correlation, though historically has been associated only as a gas tracer and remains to be explored further. We find the hot dust to have a MBB temperature of 30~K with $\beta=1.75$, the cold dust temperature of 11.3~K with $\beta=1.75$. The uncertainty in the gain for the \planck\ HFI 545 and 857 GHz bands contribute heavily to the uncertainty in these parameters, motivating a future \planck\ HFI end-to-end reanalysis. 
   % Using the final \Planck\ data release, PR4, we generate updated dust template models following a new four component model with nearby dust, dust extinction, cold dust and hot dust. The hot and cold dust have free amplitudes per pixel but fixed global temperature and spectral index $\beta$. The nearby dust is initialized with a template of dust absorption from the GAIA star catalogue, produced by \cite{edenhofer:2024}. Finally, the dust extinction is initialized with a template from the \wham\ survey. These are further constrained using the Commander Gibbs sampling framework to constrain the dust models spectral energy distributions (SEDs). For this analysis we use the \Planck\ HFI single horn channels, namely 100~GHz, 143~GHz, 217~GHz, 353~GHz, 545~GHz, and 857~GHz, as well as \FIRAS\ bands 857, 1251, 1809, 2081, 2135 and 2802 GHz. The SEDs are modelled with a spatially constant standard modified blackbody (MBB) distribution (i.e. a globally constant temperature and $\beta$ for each dust component), but with a spatially varying amplitude in the case of the cold and hot dust, and a spatially constant (fit to a template) amplitude in the case of the nearby dust and dust extinction. We find that the hot dust correlates strongly with \ion{C}{ii} emission and is found to have . The dust extinction template is the \ion{H}{$\alpha$} emission and is found to have . The cold dust finally is found to have,  and also correlates strongly with the neutral hydrogen mapped with HI4PI.

%overview, a bit why we do what we do?
Observing the Universe through a screen of foregrounds offers opportunities for both discovery and frustration. The foregrounds ultimately complicate our understanding of the backgrounds, and when poorly understood, lead to misinterpretations or increased noise on signals from those backgrounds in turn. However, a better understanding of the foregrounds allows us to uncover the physics permeating matter on all scales, from within our solar system, to the Milky Way, to distant galaxies, while simultaneously allowing us to better observe the far away signals of, for example, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the cosmic infrared background (CIB), among others. Of particular interest to this paper and the cosmology community at large is the composition of thermal dust. Thermal dust represents a significant noise contribution to future measurements of polarization $B$-modes, predicted to have been produced by gravitational waves during inflation and is the goal measurement for several ongoing or upcoming CMB experiments \citep{litebird2022,SO2019}. 

There are several types of matter within the Milky Way galaxy, aside from the aforementioned dust there is additionally gas (generating emission lines such as singly ionized carbon, \ion{C}{II}, Hydrogen emission lines such as \ion{H}{$\alpha$}, neutral hydrogen \ion{H}{I}, carbon monoxide CO and many more), stars, spinning dust, ions and electrons (interacting with magnetic fields to produce synchrotron and free-free radiation) and dark matter (only thus far interacting gravitationally). Each of these foregrounds map out relevant regions of the Milky Way and the interstellar medium (ISM). Since dust and gas live side-by-side, it is natural that one may trace the other, and indeed it is known that the neutral hydrogen signature (as observed by HI4PI for example, \citep{HI4PI2016}) and CO trace cold dust \cite{dame2001}. Other observables we can use are the reddening or extinction measurements of starlight, which occur when their light passes through dust regions \cite{lenz:2017,edenhofer:2024}. Finally, as recently shown by \cite{CG02_05}, the \ion{C}{II} emission lines as measured by FIRAS trace hot dust regions. 

The dust in the Milky Way will act to absorb radiation at frequencies close to its particle size, and re-emit as an imperfect blackbody, and historically has been modeled with a modified blackbody spectrum (MBB) characterized by a temperature, $T$, and a `tilt' to the spectrum, called the spectral index and denoted by $\beta$. These, with an amplitude ($a$), define how much radiation at a particular frequency, $\nu$, is produced CITATIONS. During the \planck\ analysis the dust in the Milky Way was modelled with a single modified blackbody fit for each pixel, or direction, in the sky. However, it is known that there are different dust populations, and with enough data it should be possible to make distinct templates modelling each independently. The challenge \planck\ faced with their analysis, of course, was that there was insufficient data to make these population distinctions, indeed there is a clear degeneracy between the dust temperature and the dust spectral index maps \citep{planck2014-a12}. 

Thus, we employ the use the nearby dust maps produced by \cite{edenhofer:2024} to map out the nearby dust in the Milky Way, to help break these degeneracies. Ideally you would have a full three-dimensional map of all the dust and gas throughout the Milky Way, but thus far we only have the dust mapped to 1.25~kpc from the Sun. \cite{edenhofer:2024} use the data from Gaia and the WISE catalogues to produces their maps, and we will discuss this data set further in \cref{sec:data}. Since we only have the dust fully mapped nearby, we additionally employ the use of the \ion{H}{$\alpha$} maps produced by the Wisconsin H-$\alpha$ mapper (WHAM) \citep{wham:2003,2016WHAM}, which was shown in \cite{CG02_05} to map out a dust extinction component in the \planck\ HFI and DIRBE bands. This is a small correction, but indicates that these regions with high \ion{H}{$\alpha$} emission are absorbing some of the dust emission light. We use these two data sets as templates, fixing the relative amplitudes between pixels, but allowing the overall amplitudes of the maps, as well as the temperature and spectral indices, to vary globally (changing the relative amplitudes between the frequencies). Finally, we have two additional dust components, called here the hot and the cold dust, which have freely varying amplitudes per pixel, but a global temperature and spectral index. Compared to the previous \planck\ analysis, which had three free parameters per pixel, we instead have 10 global parameters, with only two free parameters per pixel, for the hot and cold amplitudes. At the high resolutions for these maps this represents a significant reduction in the number of fit parameters, and has the additional benefit that we see clear correlations between the cold dust and the HI4PI maps (a known cold dust tracer), and the hot dust and \ion{C}{II}. Before \cite{CG02_05} it was not known to us that \ion{C}{II} could be used as a dust tracer, however as it is expected to be present in hot regions of the Milky Way galaxy, it is not unexpected that this might act as a tracer for the hot dust. We will discuss this and the relevant correlations in \cref{sec:correlations}. 

This paper is one of seven companion papers from the \cosmoglobe\ Data release 2 (DR2; \cite{CG02_01}), reanalyzing the \COBE-DIRBE data \citep{hauser1998}. Of particular interest for this study is new constraints on the spectrum of the CIB \citep{CG02_03}, and better constraints on all foregrounds ranging from the microwave to the infrared, including zodiacle light \citep{CG02_02} and stars \citep{CG02_04}. 
%paragraph mimicking the Dust05 
In a companion dust paper, by \cite{CG02_05}, we perform a linear regression analysis of \planck\ HFI 353-857~GHz and DIRBE 3.5-100~$\mu$m data to a five template dust model with minimal assumptions. This further demonstrates that there are distinct dust populations that can be modelled independently with sufficient data sets at a wide range of frequencies, and revealed the new dust tracer, the \ion{C}{II} line emission, to trace the hot dust. 
 Building off of that work, in the current paper we perform a Bayesian analysis of the \planck\ HFI data, deriving high-resolution templates of \ion{H}{I} and \ion{C}{II} correlated dust components, as well as the \ion{H}{$\alpha$} and nearby dust template fits. Finally, in \cite{CG02_07} this new dust model is applied to the \COBE-DIRBE data. 

%what is gonna happen in this paper
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In \cref{sec:method} we discuss broadly the methods used to produce the new sky models, including in \cref{sec:model} the data model, in \cref{sec:skymodel} the sky model, in \cref{sec:sampling} Gibbs sampling and in \cref{sec:statistics} the summary statistics analyzed to determine the best fits. Next, in \cref{sec:data} we outline the data sets used, and in \cref{sec:results} the best fit results for our new thermal dust model. In \cref{sec:gof} we discuss the goodness of fit of the model, and in \cref{sec:correlations} the correlations with external line emission maps. In \cref{sec:mbb} we compare to the previous \planck\ results and show the MBB fit to the multi-component dust model. Finally, in \cref{sec:conc} we will present our conclusions. In \cref{app:residuals} and \cref{app:GridSearchTests} we include supplementary details regarding the residuals and additional tests and figures for clarity. 

% Current dust models are not good enough (citations), and new dust models can do better (other dirbe dust papers?), using \Planck\ HFI NPIPE maps and component separation with Commander we can do better. 

% Recent results show that a four component physically motivated dust model may outperform previous models (cite Eirik and Planck, etc). These four dust models correspond to a hot-dust component (tracing the \ion{C}{II} emission), a cold-dust component, a nearby dust component (PAH) and a dust extinction (using GAIA and tracing the \ion{H}{$\alpha$} emission). We exploit the Commander 3 framework and the \planck\ PR4 data release to produce improved dust maps. 


% In \cref{sec:data} we discuss the data used for the analysis, and in \cref{sec:model}, the model used for the analysis. In \cref{sec:method} we summarize the analysis methodology using \Commander. Next, in \cref{sec:results} we present the results for the new dust model and compare with \planck's previous results in \cref{sec:planckcompare}. 
% Finally, in \cref{sec:future} we discuss future prospects and conclude in \cref{sec:conc}. Residuals comparing the data to the model are included in \cref{app:residuals}.

    \item 
\end{itemize}

% \subsection{Masks}
% \label{sec:masks}
When computing the $\chi^2$ for the grid search (see \cref{sec:statistics}) we apply a mask which removes the extreme outliers in the $\chi^2$ map, as can be seen in yellow in \cref{fig:all_masks}, this has an $f_\mathrm{sky}$ of 99\% (masking only 1\% of the sky).
During the Gibbs sampling (see \cref{sec:sampling}), we apply a 30 degree galactic plane mask to the FIRAS maps when computing monopole and dipole estimates (representing an $f_\mathrm{sky}$ of 50\%), and a large galactic cut (of areas with the largest foregrounds) to the HFI maps with an $f_\mathrm{sky}$ of 48\%, as can be seen in dark and light purple in \cref{fig:all_masks}. When estimating the gain for the 857~GHz maps we employ a small mask of $f_\mathrm{sky}$ of 95\%, as seen in orange in \cref{fig:all_masks}.

\subsection{Sky model}
\label{sec:skymodel}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Put it into context with DR2
    \item Use Eirik to justify choices
    \item big equation for $s=a_{cmb}...$ etc
\end{itemize}

The sky model for the HFI maps includes free-free (ff), carbon monoxide (CO), cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) (see \cref{fig:SkyModel}), and the four aforementioned dust components of interest. 
We keep the free-free fixed to WHICH FF MODEL DO WE USE due to the low constraining power of the HFI bands on the free-free component, additionally we keep the CO line-ratios constant for this analysis, but allow the amplitude to vary pixel-by-pixel for the three CO emission lines. 
For our four dust components, as mentioned before the hot and cold dust are each allowed to have free amplitudes for each pixel, and global\footnote{Here global refers to a single value for the entire map.} temperature and spectral index values. The nearby dust and dust extinction have fixed templates, but are allowed to vary with a global amplitude, temperature, and spectral index.  
Finally, the monopoles and dipoles are sampled for each frequency band, and we sample the gain for each of the 857~GHz bands. 

The temperature model used for this analysis may be written as a vector
\begin{align}
    \vec{s}_\nu=&u_\nu g_\nu \mathsf{B}_\nu\left[\vphantom{\left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_\mathrm{d}}\right)^{\beta_\mathrm{d}+1}}\vec{a} _\mathrm{cmb}\gamma(\nu) \right. \nonumber \\
    &+\vec{a}_\mathrm{ff}\\

where $u_\nu$ is a unit scaling conversion factor to go from brightness temperature to thermodynamic temperature, $g_\nu$ is the gain (which in this case is only sampled for 857 GHz), $\mathsf{B}_\nu$ is the beam convolution operator, $\vec{a}_{c}$ for $c\in (\mathrm{ff,cd,hd,nd,de,co})$ are the amplitudes, which are sampled per-pixel for the CMB ($\mathrm{cmb}$), cold-dust ($\mathrm{cd}$), hot dust ($\mathrm{hd}$), and the CO lines, and as a spatially constant value for the nearby dust ($\mathrm{nd}$) and dust extinction ($\mathrm{de}$). The free-free ($\mathrm{ff}$) is held fixed, as well as the CO line ratios ($h_\nu^{\{100,217,353\}})$.

\subsection{Summary statistics and optimization strategy}
\label{sec:statistics}


We found that the four dust components were highly correlated, and so we performed an extensive grid search so as to explore the parameter space efficiently, while imposing a physicality prior requiring that the large scale amplitudes of the hot and cold dust were positive, and that the temperatures of the dust components did not exceed 35~K or go lower than 10~K. Each step in the grid search used Gibbs sampling fit the 857-{1-4} gains, the amplitudes per pixel of the hot and cold dust, the CMB and the CO amplitudes, as well as monopoles and dipoles, for a set temperature and spectral index for each dust component. These amplitudes are fit through the conjugate gradient sampling routine implemented in the Commander3 framework. 


\begin{enumerate}
\item Grid search methodology?
\item Minimize chisq
\item Maximize HI correlation versus cold dust
\item Minimize correlations with nearby dust (suck up as much as possible with nearby)
\item Physicality prior
\end{enumerate}

Low correlations between the H$_\alpha$ and hot and cold dust is desirable, as it means that there is less contamination between the dust populations then in our model. As can be seen, the tested statistics are quite flat, with nearly no change in the $\chi^2$ for a wide range of temperature and spectral indices. The correlations with the hot and cold dust also remain relatively low across the grid, justifying our choice to maintain the DIRBE parameter fits, since it has greater control on this dust model at its frequencies.}

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
\subsection{\Planck\ HFI}
\label{sec:planckhfi}
The \planck\ PR4 (also known as \npipe) maps are the final \planck\ data release, improving on previous data releases by jointly analyzing the low-frequency instrument (LFI) and the  high-frequency instrument (HFI) data in a single pipeline, in addition to several other improvements (for details see \cite{planck2020-LVII}).
For this analysis we use specifically the high-frequency instrument data (HFI) because of its strong constraining power on the dust at the high frequencies. We use the single-bolometer maps to better control the gain fluctuations and better model components such as the CO-emission. Thus, we have 4 channels for the 857~GHz and 100~GHz, 3 for 545~GHz, 8 for 353 and 217~GHz and 7 for 143~GHz.\footnote{The 100~GHz and 143~GHz maps are at an \nside\ of 2048, the other frequencies are at an \nside\ of 4096.} 
We first correct all maps for the zodiacal light emission, using the \Planck\ PR2 zodiacal light model \cite{planck2014-a09, planck2013-pip88, maris2006c}, then apply a correction for the cosmic infrared background (CIB) to the 857, 545 and 353 GHz maps from the GNILC CIB results \cite{planck2016-XLVIII}.
Next, we apply a scaling correction to the root-mean squared (RMS) maps, such that the tail of the spectra matches the white-noise level from the RMS maps since the published individual bolometer frequency RMS maps have residual offsets from the analysis pipeline, evident when comparing the map and RMS power-spectra. 
Finally, the gain for 545 GHz is set to a static shift of 0.99145 for 545-1, 1.00487 for 545-2, and 1.00830 for 545-4.\footnote{The uncertainty on the 545~GHz gain is 2\% from the \NPIPE\ analysis.}
We sample for the 857~GHz gain within the analysis, all other gains and bandpass' are fixed to the \NPIPE\ values. 

\subsection{FIRAS}
\label{sec:firas}
FIRAS maps have very low calibration uncertainties, and so we use them as an extra set with which to calibrate the map amplitudes. The FIRAS 857, 1251, 1809, 2081, 2135 and 2802 GHz maps are used for this analysis in conjunction with the HFI maps. 
Specifically, the FIRAS maps are used when calculating the $\chi^2$ during one of the Gibbs loops to determine whether a step will be accepted or not, if the chi-squared calculated using the FIRAS maps is larger than the update is rejected. 


\subsection{Ancillary data}
\label{sec:otherdata}
To model the nearby dust component we use the template produced by \citet{edenhofer:2024}, which uses the star reddening from the \GAIA\ and \WISE\ star catalogues to map the dust out to 1.25~kpc from the Sun. This provides a spatial template for the nearby dust, to which we can fit an amplitude, temperature, and spectral index matching a blackbody.
Additionally, we use the Wisconsin \ion{H}{$\alpha$} mapper data as a template for the H$\alpha$ correlated dust, and the results from \citep{CG02_05} as the fiducial values for the H$\alpha$ dust emission, since it is relatively poorly constrined by the \planck\ bands (see \cref{sec:halpha}). The \ion{H}{$\alpha$} signature comes from the warm ionized medium (WIM) of the Milky Way, and maps a small extinction component in the \Planck\ bands. 
As mentioned above, we additionally correct the \planck\ HFI maps with the GNILC CIB maps \citep{planck2016-XLVIII} and the \Planck\ PR2 zodiacal light model \cite{planck2014-a09, planck2013-pip88, maris2006c}. 
When considering our summary statistics in \cref{sec:correlations} we compare the new dust templates with the CII line emission as measured by the FIRAS CII map, and to the HI4PI data \citep{HI4PI2016}.

\subsection{Hot dust SED grid (\texorpdfstring{$T_{\mathrm{hot}}$}{T hot} and \texorpdfstring{$\beta_{\mathrm{hot}}$}{b hot})}

    \item Add side by side plot of CII and hot dust?
    \item Add TT-correlation plot between CII and hot dust
    \item Discuss correlation coeff between CII and hot dust (mention masks)
    \item Add summary statistics plots from grid search
    \item Add/update full grid search plane 
\end{enumerate}


The hot dust component correlates strongly with the ionized carbon emission \ion{C}{II}, which is expected to be present around hot O and B type stars, and so as expected should correlate strongly with the \ion{C}{II} emission as seen by DIRBE/FIRAS. 
% \begin{figure}

\label{sec:colddust}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Add summary statistics plots from grid search
    \item Add/update full grid search plane 
\end{enumerate}



%  The cold dust component very neatly correlates strongy with the HI4PI data set, which maps the neutral hydrogen signature in the Milky Way. Since neutral hydrogen is only present in cold areas of the Milky Way, it is expected that these two should correlate spatially, though the HI4PI maps are not used as a template for this analysis. 

% \begin{figure}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/dust_map.pdf}
%     \caption{Cold dust}
%     \label{fig:dust_cold}
% \end{figure}

We compare the cold dust to the HI4PI maps using a standard pixel-by-pixel correlation,
\begin{align}
    \rho_{\mathrm{HI4PI,CD}}=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_p^N\frac{(a_{\mathrm{CD},p}-\overline{a}_{\mathrm{CD}})(a_{\mathrm{HI4PI},p}-\overline{a}_{\mathrm{HI4PI}})}{\sigma_{\mathrm{CD}}\sigma_{\mathrm{HI4PI}}}
\end{align}
where $a_p$ are the pixel-by-pixel amplitudes in the two maps, and $\overline{a}$ are the average amplitudes across the whole maps, and $\sigma$ the map standard deviations. 
The cold dust resolution is reduced to \nside\ of 1024 with a beam of 16.2 arcmin to match the resolution of the HI4PI maps.
We find the two maps have a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.93 (applying the same $\chi^2$ mask as in \cref{fig:chimask}). 





\subsection{Nearby dust SED grid (\texorpdfstring{$a_{\mathrm{near}}$}{a near}, \texorpdfstring{$T_{\mathrm{near}}$}{T near} and \texorpdfstring{$\beta_{\mathrm{near}}$}{b near})}

    \item Add summary statistics plots from grid search
    \item Add/update full grid search plane 
    \item Discuss the template a bit more maybe? Edenhofer...
\end{enumerate}

The nearby dust parameters (amplitude and spectral indices) are fixed to the \GAIA-based dust extinction template by \citet{edenhofer:2024}, which covers distances up to 1.25 kpc. This primarily uses \GAIA\ distances and extinction estimates to build a 3D map of the nearby dust from \citet{2023Zhang}, which also leverages the two micron all sky survey (2MASS), the wide-field infrared survey explorer (WISE and unWISE), the large sky area multi-object fibre spectroscopic telescope (LAMOST). We use the total integrated dust map for out model in this analysis.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Modified blackbody fit to multi-component dust model}
\label{sec:mbb}

Commander1 on dust model





\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}
We present the first four-component high resolution dust maps produced using the \planck\ HFI data. Two of the dust components are built from templates based on the \cite{edenhofer:2024} nearby dust map, and the \cite{2016WHAM} $\mathrm{H_\alpha}$ which we use to build our nearby dust map ($T_\mathrm{near}=18$, $\beta_{near}=1.7$), and our $\mathrm{H_\alpha}$ correlated dust map ($T_\mathrm{H\alpha}=17.8$, $\beta_{H\alpha}=2.62$). We find that the \planck\ HFI data has little constraining power on the H$_\alpha$ correlated dust, so take the best fits from DIRBE for this analysis. In addition, we generate two dust maps, corresponding to hot and cold dust populations, which have global temperature and spectral indices of $T_\mathrm{h}=30$~K, $\beta_{h}=1.75$, and $T_\mathrm{c}=11$~K, $\beta_{c}=1.85$ respectively. These maps end up having a 92\% correlation between the cold dust and the HI4PI map \cite{HI4PI2016} and a striking 95\% correlation between the hot dust and the FIRAS CII map. This indicates that this new dust model is a better fit to the data, successfully mapping physical tracers of hot and cold regions in the Milky Way, and with fewer free parameters than previous dust models. 
Future dust simulations should use these new dust maps to model Milky Way dust, and future analysis should look for similar improvements in the polarized dust populations. 
We note that the residuals are very small, and the new dust model successfully represents over 98\% of the signal in all the \planck\ HFI bands, however improved gain estimations for the 545~GHz and 857~GHz frequency channels could lead to further improvements, as well as improved CO line ratio measurements in particular in the 100~GHz bands.

% Using physically motivated dust models, we produce four new dust maps from the \planck\ PR4 HFI maps. These dust models include a cold dust component, a hot dust component (correlated with \ion{C}{II}), a nearby dust component (), and a dust extinction component (correlated with \ion{H}{$\alpha$}). These new models show improvement over previous \planck\ results, with ADD PHYSICAL REASON WE KNOW ITS BETTER. Previous analysis has indicated that a two-component dust model should out-preform the legacy single-component dust model, and this has further added physical tracers for the various components. Future analysis with the time-ordered HFI data will see further improvements to the HFI maps as well as the component separated maps, and we expect results from other experiments (CMB and beyond) to both benefit from, and contribute to, these new component maps. 

% In this analysis we only explore the intensity or dust temperature, future work should explore the polarized dust in a similar manner, with the aim of creating physically motivated dust templates as was done in Eiriks paper ADD REFERENCE. Future work will also explore the HFI data from the raw time-ordered data (as was done in \Cosmoglobe\ DR1 and \BeyondPlanck ADD REFERENCES) including the updated dust models here from the \npipe\ analysis. This will lead to improved gain modeling, and zodiacal light modeling, two obvious areas of improvement when considering the residuals (see \cref{app:residuals}). 
% These dust templates have been applied to the \Cosmoglobe\ DR2 results with DIRBE, and results can be seen in Eiriks second paper ADD REFERENCE. 
% We have already seen great benefit in using data sets beyond the standard CMB maps, and we expect with many high-fidelity experiments online or soon to come online (SUCH AS? SPHEREX? SO? ), we may find more or better tracers of the dust, allowing us to further improve these models.

\section{Residuals}
\label{app:residuals}
We can see the fidelity of the sky model by looking at the difference between the data and the model at each of the bands (see \cref{fig:residuals}). The residuals indicate potential for improvement to the modelling of the zodiacal light, as well as improvements to the 545~GHz gain. The incredibly low residuals in the 100, 143, 217 and 353~GHz maps demonstrate the great capabilities of this model.

\section{Grid search tests}
\label{app:GridSearchTests}
Here we present some of the point from the grid search for each of the dust components. 
\subsection{Cold dust}
As can be seen in \cref{fig:SEDGridContours}, there is an unphysical space mapped by the hottest and higher spectral index in the cold dust grid. This corresponds to large over-subtraction and negative areas in the hot dust amplitudes as can be seen in \cref{fig:cold_hot_dust_set}.

    \caption{Hot dust (\ion{C}{II} correlated dust) amplitudes for varying $T_\mathrm{c}$ and $\beta_\mathrm{c}$ values with all other grid parameters set to the fiducial values as recorded in \cref{tab:SEDs}.

    \label{fig:cold_cold_dust_set}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Hot dust}
Similar to with the cold dust, in \cref{fig:SEDGridContours}, there is an unphysical space mapped by the coldest and lowest spectral index in the hot dust grid. This corresponds to large over-subtraction and negative areas in the cold dust amplitudes as can be seen in \cref{fig:hot_cold_dust_set}.

    \label{fig:hot_hot_dust_set}

    \label{fig:hot_cold_dust_set}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Nearby Dust}
The nearby dust was found to have unphysical regions banded both by the cold dust amplitudes and the hot dust amplitudes. We wanted to minimized correlations between the cold and nearby, and hot and nearby, dust, such that the dust population described by the nearby dust was an independent dust component. 
% As can be seen in \cref{fig:near_cold_dust_set,fig:near_hot_dust_set} the hottest points in the nearby dust grid lead to high correlations with the hot dust and anti-correlations with the cold dust, and vise versa for the coldest points.

    \label{fig:near_cold_dust_set}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{\texorpdfstring{H$\alpha$}{Ha} dust}
The parameter space explored for the H$_\alpha$ correlated dust was shown to have a very flat $chi^2$ profile, and minimal changes to the hot and cold dust amplitudes or correlations. As such we chose to take the DIRBE fit values from \cite{CG02_05} for our fiducial values, as we expect the DIRBE bands to have better control of these SED parameters.
