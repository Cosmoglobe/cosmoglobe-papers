   \abstract{We fit five tracers of thermal dust emission to ten \textit{Planck} HFI and \textit{COBE}-DIRBE frequency maps between 353\,GHz and 25\,THz, aiming to map the relative importance of each physical host environment as a function of frequency and position on the sky. Four of these correspond to classic thermal dust tracers, namely \textsc{H i} (HI4PI), CO (Dame et al. 2001), H$\alpha$ (WHAM), and dust extinction (\textit{Gaia}), while the fifth is ionized carbon (\textsc{C ii}) emission as observed by \textit{COBE}-FIRAS. To our knowledge, this has until now been considered to be primarily a gas tracer, rather than a dust tracer. After smoothing all data to the common resolution of the FIRAS experiment, and subtracting subdominant astrophysical components as appropriate for each channel (CMB, CIB, and zodiacal light), we jointly fit these five templates to each frequency channel through standard multi-variate linear regression. At frequencies higher than 1\,THz, we find that the dominant tracer is \textsc{C ii}, and above 10\,THz this component accounts for almost the entire fitted signal; at frequencies below 1\,THz, its importance is second only to \textsc{H i}. We further find that all five components are well described by a modified blackbody spectral energy density (SED) up to some component-dependent maximum frequency ranging between 1 and 5\,THz. In this interpretation the \textsc{C ii}-correlated component is the hottest among all five with an effective temperature of about 25\,K. For comparison, the \textsc{H i} and CO components have effective temperatures of 16\,K and 12\,K, respectively. The H$\alpha$ component has a temperature of 18\,K, and, unlike the other four, is observed in absorption rather than emission. The spectral indices of the five components range between $\beta = 1.4$ (for \textsc{H i}) and 2.6 (for H$\alpha$); for the \textsc{C ii} component it is $\beta=1.56$. Despite the simplicity of this model, which relies only external templates coupled to spatially isotropic SEDs, we find that it captures 98\,\% of the full signal rms below 1\,THz. At higher frequencies, which are more susceptible to non-thermal emission processes, the model still captures more than 80\,\% of the full signal rms. This high efficiency suggests that spatial variations in the thermal dust SED, as for instance reported by \Planck\ and other experiments, may be more economically modelled on large angular scales in terms of a spatial mixing of individually isotropic physical components, than by a single uniform well-mixed interstellar medium coupled to a spatially varying temperature field, as has been the norm until now. Indeed, the results found in this paper motivates the thermal dust model adopted for the \textsc{Cosmoglobe} DR2 re-analysis of the \textit{COBE}-DIRBE data, and we believe that they may also provide inspiration for refining both current theoretical ISM models and component separation algorithms in general.}

\section{Introduction}
%\the\textwidth \the\columnwidth

The interstellar medium (ISM) plays a ubiquitous role in modern
astrophysics and cosmology across the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., \citealt{draine2011}, \citealt{Hensley2023}). On 
one hand, understanding the composition and physics of the ISM informs
us about the structure and dynamics of both the Milky Way and distant
galaxies, and ISM studies are therefore an important and interesting
field of astronomy in their own right. On the other hand, ISM radiation
is a key contaminant for a broad range of other high-impact
science targets, for instance the search for gravitational waves in
the cosmic microwave background (CMB), or dark matter annihilation in
gamma-ray observations, or dark energy constraints through
high-precision measurements of distant supernovae. Accurate ISM
modelling is therefore a key aspect in 21st century
astrophysics.

Broadly speaking, the interstellar medium comprises cosmic rays
(relativistic particles), gas (atoms or small molecules), and dust
(large molecules, typically ranging in size from a few angstroms to
100\,$\mu$m). All of these emit electromagnetic radiation at various
frequencies, for instance through synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, quantum
mechanical line emission, or thermal emission. In addition, dust
grains absorb electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths that are
comparable to the grain size, which due to the grain distribution
happens most notably in wavelengths ranging from infrared to
X-rays. 

The current paper is part of a suite of seven companion papers that
describes \Cosmoglobe\ Data Release 2 (DR2; \citealp{CG02_01}). The
primary main goal of this work is to reanalyze the \COBE-DIRBE data
\citep{hauser1998} within an global Bayesian end-to-end analysis
framework, and use the resulting data to constrain the spectrum of the
cosmic infrared background (CIB; \citealp{CG02_03}). The DIRBE
instrument observed the full sky in 10 wavelength bands covering 1.25
and 240\,$\mu$m. By virtue of covering virtually the entire infrared
regime, DIRBE is an excellent dust tracer, both originating from the
Milky Way and from within the Solar system. Indeed, while DIRBE's
original science goal was to detect and characterize the CIB spectrum
and fluctuations, the most long-lasting legacy of the survey has
arguably been to serve as unique well-calibrated full-sky tracer of
dust emission in the Milky Way 
\citep{schlegel1998,IRIS,planck2014-a12,sano2016,pysm_methods}
%(ADD LOTS OF REFERENCES)
and zodiacal
light emission \citep[e.g.,][]{K98,planck2013-pip88,2016AJ....151...71K,CG02_02,obrien2025}.% (include other recent references, CIBER for example).

One of the key questions in which the DIRBE data has played a role
regards the nature and composition of thermal dust emission in the
far-infrared regime, and how it may be modelled most
efficiently. Early studies quickly suggested that a single so-called
modified blackbody (MBB) spectrum provides a good fit to the thermal
dust spectral energy density (SED) for a broad range of frequencies
\citep{reach1995b}. An MBB spectrum has three degrees of freedom, namely
an overall amplitude (tracing the density of the medium), an effective
temperature, $T$, and a spectral index, $\beta$. To this date, the
single-component MBB model plays a key role in both microwave
modelling and infrared-based dust studies.

However, it also quickly became clear that the validity of a single
MBB spectrum is limited in frequencies. Notably, in a seminal paper
\citet{finkbeiner:1999} presented a two-component
MBB thermal dust model derived from the \IRAS\ 100\,$\mu$m and DIRBE 100
and 240\,$\mu$m data that served as a benchmark for the CMB community for more than a decade, and was
only superseded by the far more sensitive \Planck\ HFI data
\citep{planck2013-p06b}. Since that time, the combination of
\Planck, DIRBE, and \IRAS\ measurements have dominated the study of
large-scale dust emission at microwave and far-infrared frequencies.

Despite massive efforts developing increasingly more accurate
and well-defined models of thermal dust emission, combining
theoretical insights with observational constraints (ADD REFERENCES),
many critical questions plague this field to date. Furthermore,
the importance of understanding microwave dust emission has only increased in recent
years, as the attention of the CMB field has shifted to the search for
inflationary gravitational waves through $B$-mode polarization
constraints. For such experiments, polarized thermal dust emission
represents one of the most important contaminants, and major resources
are currently being invested in devising both instrumentational and
data analysis techniques to handle this challenge optimally. 

In the current paper, and in two companion papers by \citet{CG02_06}
and \citet{CG02_07}, we revisit the question of how to model thermal
dust emission efficiently in light of the currently reprocessed DIRBE
data, jointly with archival measurements from
\Planck\ HFI. Specifically, during the course of the \Cosmoglobe\ DR2
work, a new five-component MBB model has emerged as a particularly
compact and efficient description. Although a five-component model may
at first sight appear as significantly more complicated than either
the standard single-component MBB model adopted by the \Planck\ team,
or by the two-component MBB model pioneered by
\citet{finkbeiner:1999}, the key point in our new analysis is that all
five components are well traced by well-known dust templates coupled
with spatially isotropic SEDs. The number of degrees of freedom per
pixel is therefore very small, allowing for a very rigid and compact
statistical description.

Four out of the five templates in this model are already known to be
efficient dust tracers, namely 1) HI4PI \HI\ line emission tracing
molecular gas; 2) \GAIA\ extinction, tracing near-by dust absorption; 3)
\citet{dame:2001} CO line emission, tracing cold dust in star-forming
regions; and 4) WHAM H$\alpha$ line emission, tracing hot dust in
ionized regions. However, in this paper and its companion papers we
find additionally that ionized carbon emission, as traced by the FIRAS
\CII\ 158\,$\mu$m line emission map, is an excellent tracer of thermal
dust emission with a temperature of $\sim$30\,K. This observation may
have far-reaching consequences for future studies and models of dust
emission in the microwave and infrared regimes.

In the current paper, we perform a linear regression analysis of
\Planck\ HFI 353--857\,GHz and DIRBE 3.5--100\,$\mu$m data with this
model, which demonstrates the validity of this key finding even with a
minimal set of assumptions. In a follow-up analysis by \citet{CG02_06},
we perform a Bayesian analysis of \Planck\ HFI data with the goal of
deriving high-resolution templates of the \HI\ and \CII\ correlated
components directly from microwave data. Finally, \citet{CG02_07}
applies this novel model to the \COBE-DIRBE data.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect.~\ref{sec:dr2}
we give a brief overview of the data model adopted for the
\Cosmoglobe\ DR2 reanalysis. Next, in Sect.~\ref{sec:tempfit} we
describe both the template fitting algorithm and data used in the
current paper. In Sect.~\ref{sec:results} we present the results from
these calculations, before we conclude in Sect.~\ref{sec:conclusions}.



\section{Bayesian modelling of the infrared sky with \Cosmoglobe\ DR2}
\label{sec:dr2}

Interstellar dust -- amorphous particles of silicate and carbonaceous materials
-- makes its presence known on practically all astrophysically relevant
wavelengths. The efforts to classify and describe this material is significant
in its own right, but knowing its properties also allows for better and more
precise astrophysical foreground removal in cases where interstellar dust
emission contaminate the other signals of interest.\footnote{For a recent
review, see \cite{Hensley2021}.}

Recently, the ``astrodust+PAH'' model \citep{Hensley2023} was introduced, wherein
the diffuse interstellar medium is hypothesised to be made up of a single
composite material (the eponymous astrodust) for scales larger than
$\sim0.02~\mu$m, and a distinct variety of materials -- including so-called
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) -- on scales smaller than this.

In the wavelength regime between $3000-100~\mu$m, this model is described well
 by a modified blackbody spectral energy density (SED),\footnote{The actual
 astrodust model is made up of a composite MBB which has a transition between
353 and 217 GHz.} that is, a SED with the following behavior
\begin{equation}
s(\nu) \propto \nu^\beta B(\nu, T),
\label{eq:mbb}
\end{equation}
where $\nu$ is the frequency, $B$ is the Planck law for a perfect blackbody,
and $\beta$ is the spectral index. Typical temperatures of this blackbody in
the diffuse ISM is around $\sim$ 20 K, meaning that the distribution typically
peaks around 150\,$\mu$m ($\sim 2000$ GHz).

At lower wavelengths (2.5\,$\mu$m--12\,$\mu$m), the astrodust+PAH model is
mostly dominated by the nanoscale particle emission, and exhibits strong
emission lines at various wavelengths (see Fig.~10 in \citealt{Hensley2023}).

This is a general picture -- typically, in a given line-of-sight the relative
contribution of various dust components will vary. At the same time, the degree
to which such variations can be detected and described is limited by the
resolution and signal-to-noise ratios of the available data at the wavelengths
involved. For example, .... Thus classifying populations of interstellar dust
with common spectral parameters has been of high importance.

One natural distinction that has been made is between ``hot'' and ``cold''
dust. If we are able to divide the interstellar dust into components of high
and low energy, such components could lend themselves to be traced by
independent probes of interstellar matter. For the low-energy component, a
natural tracer would be the \HI\ column density as measured by experiments such
as HI4PI. The hot dust component, similarly, could be traced by other measures
of high-energy regions, with the traditional candidates being either the
H$\alpha$ or \CII\ spectral lines.

In addition to this, we may also use known distance information to infer
various dust populations. As an example, \cite{edenhofer:2024} constructed a
series of high-resolution (\nside\ 256) extinction maps using data from \GAIA\ and

MORE HERE ON WHAM ETC

The current paper is part of the \Cosmoglobe\ DR2 suite, meaning that our dust
modelling is one part of a larger global Bayesian end-to-end analysis. In the
\Cosmoglobe\ framework, the standard modus operandi is to begin with an explicit
parametric model incorporating all known aspects of the dataset with which we
are working -- including both instrumental effects as well as a physical model
of what is being observed. For instance, the DIRBE time-ordered data (TOD) used
in this analysis have been parametrized thus:
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:model}
    \dv_{\mathrm{dirbe}} &=\G\P\left[\B\sum_{c=1}^{n_{\mathrm{comp}}}\M_c\a_c+\s_{\mathrm{zodi}} +
          \s_{\mathrm{static}}\right] + \n \\
                         & \equiv \s^{\mathrm{tot}} + \n \nonumber,
\end{align}
where $\dv$ is the stacked TODs, $\G$ is an overall gain factor, $\P$ is the
pointing matrix which projects the physical sky onto a $n_{\mathrm{tod}}$-sized
space, $\B$ is the instrumental beam convolution operator, and $\n$ is the
instrumental noise. The physical sky is represented by the next three terms:
first, a sum over sky components that can be modelled as constant at every
point in time (in galactic coordinates) -- the sum is over a HEALPix map of
amplitudes for each sky component ($\a_c$) multiplied by a mixing matrix which
extrapolates the given component to the frequencies observed; secondly, there
is a term representing the zodiacal emission, which cannot be treated as a time
constant; finally there is a term representing a component that is static in
solar coordinates, which may either be related to the DIRBE sidelobes, or be
geniune excess radiation originating in the Solar System. These two last terms
are treated in \citet{CG02_02} and \citet{CG02_03}, and what concerns us in the
present work is the first of the three terms, which we can write out more
explicitly as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:skymodel}
\begin{aligned}
  \sum_{c=1}^{n_{\mathrm{comp}}} \M_c \a_c  = \,
  &\M_{\mathrm{mbb}}(\bcold,\Tcold,\nuzerocold)\vec{a}_{\mathrm{cold}}
  && \textrm{(Cold dust)} \\
  + &\M_{\mathrm{mbb}}(\bhot,\Thot,\nuzerohot)
  \vec{a}_{\mathrm{hot}} && \textrm{(Hot dust)}\\
  + &\M_{\mathrm{mbb}}(\bnear,\Tnear,\nuzeronear) \t_{\mathrm{near}}
  a_{\nu} && \textrm{(Nearby dust)} \\
  + &\left(\frac{\nuzeroff}{\nu}\right)^2
  \frac{g_{\mathrm{ff}}(\nu;\Te) }{g_{\mathrm{ff}}(\nuzeroff;\Te)}
  \vec{t}_{\mathrm{ff}} && \textrm{(Free-free)} \\
  + &\delta(\nu-\nu_{0,\mathrm{CO}}^i) \t_{\mathrm{CO}}
  h^{\mathrm{CO}}_{\nu,i} && \textrm{(CO)}\\
  + &\delta(\nu-\nu_{0,\cii}) \a_{\cii}
	h^{\cii}_{\nu} && (\cii)\\
  + &U_{\mathrm{mJy}} \sum_{j=1}^{n_{\mathrm{s}}}
  f_{\mathit{Gaia},j} a_{\mathrm{s},j}, &\quad&
  \textrm{(Bright stars)} \\
  + &U_{\mathrm{mJy}} f_{\mathit{Gaia},j} \a_{\mathrm{fs},j}, &\quad&
  \textrm{(Faint stars)} \\  
    + &U_{\mathrm{mJy}} \sum_{j=1}^{n_{\mathrm{e}}}
  M_{\mathrm{mbb}}(\beta_{\mathrm{e},j},
  T_{\mathrm{e},j}, \nu_{0,\mathrm{e}})
  a_{\mathrm{e},j} && \textrm{(FIR sources)}\\
  + &m_{\nu} && \textrm{(Monopole)}. 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

As it stands, this is as ``complete'' of a static model we currently can write down
for the frequency domain we are dealing with in this paper. The first three
terms is the complete model of thermal dust, which is the main focus of this
work, and will be elaborated on below. The fourth term models the free-free
dust component, which is expected to contribute moderately at all relevant
frequencies without becoming a dominant term. The next two terms describe CO
and \CII\ line emission that show up as delta function-like contributions to the
total signal at certain frequencies (TODO). Then, there are three point source
terms, all of which are dealt with in \citet{CG02_04}. Finally, the final term
represents the monopole at each frequency, which is also treated in
\citet{CG02_03}.

As mentioned, this work is part of a global analysis of data spanning
100\,GHz--2400\,THz, wherein we draw samples from the \emph{posterior}
distribution of the full set of parameters that enter the analysis
\citep{CG02_01} -- in formulaic terms, we are mapping out $P(\theta | \dv)$,
the probability distribution of the set of parameters $\theta$ given the
observed data $\dv$. Bayes' theorem allows us to write
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:bayestheorem}
    P(\theta|\dv) = \frac{P(\dv|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(\dv)},
\end{equation}
and, since $P(\dv)$ typically only enters as a normalizing term as long as the
parameter space does not change, sampling from $P(\theta|\dv)$ is (modulo a
prior term) is equivalent to sampling from
$P(\dv|\theta)\equiv\mathcal{L}(\theta)$, the so-called \emph{likelihood}
function.

The number of parameters involved in our model (Eq. \ref{eq:model}) is of the
order of millions, making sampling from the likelihood function a non-trivial
task. The \Cosmoglobe\ framework is based on the \Commander software
\citep{eriksen:2004,seljebotn:2019,bp03}, which maps out the posterior
parameter distribution through a process called \emph{Gibbs sampling}
\citep[e.g.,][]{geman:1984}, a Monte-Carlo method based on sequentially
sampling each parameter (or a subset of parameters) from their respective
marginal distributions wrt. all other parameters. The theory of Gibbs sampling
then says that by combining these samples into a full set for all the
parameters involved, this set will represent a proper sample from the joint
distribution. Applied to Eq. \ref{eq:model}, we get a sequence of operations as
follows:

\end{equation}

Here, the symbol $\leftarrow$ indicates the operation of drawing a sample from
the distribution on the right-hand side. After some burn-in period, the
resulting joint parameter sets will correspond to samples drawn from the true
underlying joint posterior.

Since every step of the Gibbs sampling process assumes that all other
parameters are ``given'', we can now treat a highly interconnected problem
(i.e. sampling from the joint posterior of all parameters involved in our data
model) as a highly modular one -- meaning that we can perform each
``sub-analysis'' without being concerned with the other parts of the problem.
Hence, in this paper, we mainly focus on the three first components of Eq.
(\ref{eq:skymodel}), and leave the other components for other papers. (TODO
maybe actually cite those papers)

As mentioned above, we here adopt a model for thermal dust that comprises three
distinct components, represented by the first three terms of Eq.
(\ref{eq:skymodel}). All three components are modelled as having a continuous
modified blackbody behaviour between 100 and 1050~GHz, i.e. below the DIRBE
frequencies, multiplied by an amplitude per pixel, which for two of the
components is allowed to vary as a free parameter in the Gibbs chain, and for
the last component is defined as full-sky template.

The spectral parameters -- that is, $\beta$ and $T$ in Eq. (\ref{eq:mbb}) -- of
this model are set to be constant across the sky for each of the three
components. Thus, each of the component has a different spectral parameter pair
than the others, but it is not allowed to vary spatially.

For the frequencies covered by DIRBE bands 3--10, we extend this model in the
following way: We define a set of SED bins, each of which is chosen to
correspond to the width of the DIRBE bands, as shown in table \ref{tab:bins}.
Each of these bins are associated with a free parameter for that dust
component; namely, the amplitude of the SED in that bin. In other words, the
SED for a given component for a given SED bin is a constant, but the exact
value of this constant is allowed to vary in the Gibbs chain.

%Since the phenomenology of thermal dust gets more complicated above 1050~GHz
%(see sec. \ref{sec:current_dust}), instead of adopting a model based on
%underlying physics, we define a set of bins, each of which is chosen to roughly
%correspond to the width of DIRBE bands 3-10, respectively, as shown in Table
%\ref{tab:bins}. Each of the bins is assigned an amplitude for each dust
%component, and the SED of that component for the frequencies encompassed by a
%given bin is given by the amplitude assigned to that bin\footnote{Only one of
%    the three components are allowed to have nonzero amplitudes at DIRBE band 3
%and 4 -- see below}. We do not define such bins for DIRBE bands 1 and 2, and we
%force the total dust SED to be zero at these bands, since the thermal dust
%emission is expected to be negligible at these frequenies.

The first component we call ``nearby dust''. We define this component in order
to properly utilize the available knowledge about nearby dust structure --
several works, such as \citet{Dharmawardena:2024} and \citet{edenhofer:2024}
use extinction data from catalogues such as Gaia to infer the dust structure
out to 1-3~kpc. We define a template (see Section \ref{sec:data} for a detailed
explanation of this template) which traces these nearby dust structures. The
complete SED of this component is thus defined as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:nearby_dust}
    s(\nu) = \begin{cases} a\t\nu^{\beta} B(\nu, T) & \nu \in [100,
        1050~\text{GHz}] \\
        a^i_{\textrm{bin}}\t & \nu \in [\nu_{\textrm{bin, start}}^i,
        \nu_{\textrm{bin, end}}^i]
            \end{cases},
\end{equation}
where $a$ is a scaling parameter, $\t$ is the nearby dust template, and the
remaining parameters on the first line are the same as in Eq.~(\ref{eq:mbb}),
and $\nu_{\textrm{bin, start}}^i$ and $\nu_{\textrm{bin, end}}^i$ are the start
and end frequencies of bin $i$, respectively.

The two next components are not constrained spatially by templates; rather,
their amplitudes are allowed to vary from pixel to pixel. We call these
components ``cold'' and ``hot'' dust, respectively, and their SEDs can both be
expressed as follows,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:coldhotdust}
    s(\nu) = \begin{cases} \a\nu^{\beta} B(\nu, T) & \nu \in [100,
        1050~\text{GHz}] \\
        a^i_{\textrm{bin}} & \nu \in [\nu_{\textrm{bin, start}}^i,
        \nu_{\textrm{bin, end}}^i]
            \end{cases},
\end{equation}
where $\a$ is the vector of per-pixel amplitudes. The only difference between
the two components is that SED amplitude of the hot dust component is allowed
to be nonzero for bins 7 and 8 (DIRBE bands 3 and 4), while the cold dust
(as well as the nearby dust) SEDs are only allowed to be nonzero for bins 1--6
(DIRBE bands 10 through 5).

With this model, we are effectively operating with roughly two degrees of
freedom per pixel -- namely, the hot and cold dust amplitudes. The rest of the
parameters are all spatially constant, and so adds just fractional degrees of
freedom to the total dust model.

We emphasize that this model is mostly phenomenological, and we are already
planning several improvements to the model to be published in the future.
However, already with this relatively crude model the results are of sufficient
interest for the community that we think it worthwhile to report.

\section{Template fitting methodology}
\label{sec:tempfit}

As the aim of this paper mainly is to investigate the feasibility of describing
thermal dust as a linear combination of components -- components that
reasonably can be imagined to be associated with the thermal dust in the galaxy
-- we perform a fitting of such components to existing data \emph{outside} of
the \Cosmoglobe\ framework proper. That is, we here attempt to fit the
abovementioned components directly to dust-dominated \Planck\ HFI and DIRBE data,
and we do this without any joint modelling like the one used in \Cosmoglobe.

In order to perform such a fit, we first assume all components and all data on
which we wish to perform the fit are given as HEALPix maps in the same
resolution (see section \ref{sec:data} for more on this). For each data set
$\dv_i$ at a given frequency band $i$ (bold notation here implies a
vector of $n_\mathrm{pix}$ HEALPix pixels), the basic data model we employ is

\begin{equation}
    \dv_i = \sum_c a_{i, c} \t_c + m_i + \n_i,
    \label{eq:datamodel}
\end{equation}
where the sum runs over the $n$ components that we assume to be
adequate dust tracers, and where $a_{i, c}$ is the amplitude that best
describes the given component's contribution to the frequency the given data
was measured at. $\t_c$ denotes the spatial template of component $c$.
In addition, we include a monopole term, $m_i$, and a white noise contribution
$\n_i$. We thus assume that the data does \emph{not} include a CMB
contribution or a dipole term (again, see section \ref{sec:data} for how we
deal with these assumptions).

We allow for masking of the data and components, with the only effect being to
make each vector in the equation shorter, and $n_\mathrm{pix}$ in what follows is the
effective number of pixels after masking.

Given this model, the main goal becomes to find the set of amplitudes $a_{i,
c}$ (and monopole) that jointly minimize the residual
\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol r_i \equiv \dv_i - \boldsymbol s_i,
\end{equation}
where we define $s_i$ to be all the terms on the right hand side of eq.
\ref{eq:datamodel} except the white noise term.

This kind of minimization for a linear problem has a well-known solution. We
annotate our solution vector at each frequency band as $\mathbf{a}_i$ (which in
this case is an $n+1$-dimensional vector, the extra dimension being due to the
monopole contribution), and we can then write
\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{a}_i = (\mathsf{T}^T \mathsf{T})^{-1} (\mathsf{T}^T\boldsymbol{d}) ,
    \label{eq:lss}
\end{equation}
where we define $\mathsf{T}$ as a $n_\mathrm{pix}$ by $n+1$ matrix such that matrix
column $c$ contains component template $\boldsymbol{t}_c$ (and the final column
is a constant, representing the monopole). Implicit in this way of solving for
the amplitudes is the assumption that the noise RMS is constant from pixel to
pixel -- at the resolutions used for this analysis, this is a fair assumption,
as large-scale instrumental features are dominated by systematic effects rather
than white noise. Applying this equation, the solution vector will then have as
its $n+1$ elements the best-fit amplitudes for each component (and best-fit
monopole).


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
Since we are in this papers mostly concerned with economical dust modelling, we
use the most accurate data available in the frequency ranges where dust
dominates. More specifically, we here use \Planck\ HFI data from 353 GHz
upwards, as well as DIRBE data from the 6 longest-wavelength bands 
(from 240\,$\mu\mathrm m$  to $12\,\mu\mathrm m$).

We use five known or derived dust tracers as component templates: The
\COBE-FIRAS \CII\ observations, the HI4PI neutral hydrogen map, the Dame CO
$J=1\rightarrow0$ map, the WHAM ionized hydrogen map, and a derived map of
nearby dust structures based on GAIA observations. We note that the fitting
procedure described in Section \ref{sec:tempfit} does not require that we use
the same templates for all data bands, and because some of these five templates
are only expected to be relevant at lower frequencies, we will restrict the
number of templates used for each band according to table \ref{tab:bands}. We
provide justification for these restrictions below, on a per-component basis.

\begin{table*}

%This paper concerns itself with a subset of the total global analysis which is
%described more fully in \cite{CG02_01}; namely, the part of the analysis that
%models the three thermal dust components. Describing the data that goes into
%this part of the analysis is two-tiered, in the sense that there may be (and in
%this case, is) data that is used in the total global analysis which is not
%directly used for fitting the dust models, and then there is data that
%\emph{is} directly used for this purpose. However, even the data that is not
%directly used to fit our dust models still affect the total analysis by
%affecting the overall data model fit (eq.~\ref{eq:skymodel}).

Below, we first describe the DIRBE and \Planck\ HFI data before describing the
dust tracing templates in more detail, and for which frequencies they are
enabled in the analysis. Finally, we describe the preprocessing
and masking used for this analysis.

\subsection{Frequency maps}

\subsubsection{DIRBE}
The Diffuse InfraRed Explorer DIRBE, whose main goal was the mapping out of the
CIB, was part of the \COBE\ satellite \citep{boggess92, silverberg93}, and
measured the sky in ten frequency bands from $1\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ to
$240\,\mathrm{\mu m}$. 

In this analysis, we started from the $\nside=512$ maps
created with the procedure described in \cite{CG02_01} from the DIRBE CIO
(Calibrated Individual Observations). The shortest-wavelength features of thermal
dust are the PAH features, which are expected to be detectable in the the
spectrum down to a few microns \citep{Hensley2021}; we therefore here include the 8
longest-wavelength bands of DIRBE, ranging from $240\,\mu\mathrm m$ to $3.5\,\mu\mathrm m$.

\subsubsection{Planck HFI}
The \Planck\ High Frequency Instrument (HFI; \citealt{planck2016-l03}) observed
the sky in six frequency channels from 100 GHz to 857 GHz, with the primary
purpose being characterizing temperature fluctuations in the CMB to
unprecedentedly small scales. As it also was able to target the far-infrared
sky, it is able to shed light on the dust component
\citep{planck2013-XVII,planck2014-a12,planck2016-l03}.

Since this work is primarily concerned with dust modeling, we attempt to avoid
contamination from especially the CMB signal which starts to dominate at the
lower \Planck\ frequencies. To that end, we use only the HFI data from
353-857\,GHz. All the frequency maps are from the \Planck\ PR4 data release
\citep{npipe}.

%The \Planck\ High Frequency Instrument (HFI; \citealt{planck2016-l03}) observed the sky in six channels from 100\,GHz to 857\,GHz from May 2009--2013, with angular resolution of 10\arcm--\,4\arcm. While the primary purpose of the \Planck\ mission was to characterize fluctuations in the CMB, a large part of its scientific legacy comes from its observations of the far-infrared sky, with robust characterization of the Milky Way \citep{planck2013-XVII,planck2014-a12,planck2016-l03} and of CIB fluctuations \citep{planck2014-a12,planck2013-XVII,lenz2019,mccarthy:2024}.
%
%In addition to its complementary observation strategy, \Planck's frequency coverage has a relatively lower expected amount of zodiacal emission, with a total expected amplitude of $\lesssim1\,\%$ before any subtraction \citep{maris2006c,planck2013-pip88}, as compared to almost 100\,\% of the signal in some DIRBE bands. All delivered \Planck\ maps have had an estimate of the zodiacal emission modeled using the 3D model derived by K98 with varying emissivities per component. While this technically is redundant information that could contaminate this joint analysis, the already low amplitude of zodiacal emission in the HFI maps limits the potential impact of using a technically incorrect zodiacal emission model. A full analysis fitting for zodiacal emission parameters using both HFI and DIRBE will be left for future work.
%
%At the same time, CIB fluctuations with a similar SED to the Milky Way have been detected with high significance in the HFI data, and are directly visible in 353--857\,GHz maps at high Galactic latitudes. Incorrectly modeled, this could bias the Galactic thermal dust model and lead to an incorrect model of the sky in the DIRBE range. In order to avoid this, we remove the GNILC \citep{planck2016-XLVIII} estimate of the CIB from the HFI maps before including them in our analysis.

  \caption{Input thermal dust tracers used for low-resolution template fitting. }
  \label{fig:tempfit_inputs}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Ionized carbon --- \COBE-FIRAS \CII}
The \COBE-FIRAS instrument is still the only full-sky spectrometric survey in
the radio and infrared electromagnetic wavelengths, and as such, it provides
the best full-sky measurement of spectral line emission. The $157.7\,\mu\mathrm m$ \CII\
line emission has previously been recognized as a gas tracer; here, we
investigate its potential as a tracer of interstellar dust.

We use the \COBE-FIRAS \CII\ map, available on the LAMBDA website.\footnote{\url{lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov}} As this is the lowest-resolution map in the
analysis, we do not perform any preprocessing on the map before using it as a
template.

\subsubsection{Neutral hydrogen -- HI4PI}
The HI4PI HI survey \citep{HI4PI:2016} is a full-sky survey of the 21 cm
hydrogen line, performed by a combination of data from EBHIS and GASS. The 21
cm line has been used as a tracer for dust structures \citep{planck2011-7.12},
and 

\subsubsection{Dust extinction -- Gaia}
One source of important information about the 3-dimensional structure of dust is starlight extinction. By comparing expected stellar spectra with observed ones, Edenhofer et al. (REFERENCE) was able to reconstruct such dust structures up to a distance of (TBD), represented by a series of maps for each distance bin. Using the accompanying software, we integrated these maps out to their furthest distance, which still represents relatively close dust structures, galactically speaking, and we use this as a template for nearby dust. The choice of the distance cut is driven more by the available Edenhofer maps than any physical considerations; still, in this work, this seems to be the best way of utilizing the available additional information about the dust morphology that these maps represent.


\subsubsection{Ionized hydrogen -- WHAM}

\subsubsection{Carbon monoxide -- Dame CO\,$J=1$-0}

\subsection{Low-resolution preprocessing}
The template fitting procedure described in section \ref{sec:tempfit} requires
all maps to be smoothed to a common resolution -- if not, the extra degrees of
freedom at smaller scales in some of the maps and templates might bias the fit
at larger scales. Out of all the data and templates used in this analysis, the
\COBE-FIRAS \CII\ map is the one with the lowest native resolution. We therefore
convolve all maps with the \COBE-FIRAS beam, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:firasbeam},
and we repixelate all maps to an HEALPix \nside\ of 16.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/firas_beam.pdf}
  \caption{The \COBE-FIRAS beam, with which all maps in this analysis were smoothed.}
  \label{fig:firasbeam}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Processing mask}
The FIRAS CII map in particular contains systematic effects, which we mask in this analysis. In addition, due to the complexity of the galactic center, as well as certain high-activity complexes (TBD), we mask these as well. 

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Template amplitude fits}
\label{sec:tempamp}

The fit template amplitudes per frequency band are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:tempamp}. As is evident, the spectra of all templates show a characteristic bump, which is the expected behavior of modified blackbody SEDs with temperatures in the typical thermal dust temperature range (see below for actual temperature estimations of these spectra).

We also see that the H$\alpha$ component has a negative SED, showing that it indeed functions as a dust extinction template.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/tempamp_v1.pdf}
  \caption{Template amplitudes. }
  \label{fig:tempamp}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Model efficiency and goodness-of-fit}
\label{sec:residuals}
In Figs. \ref{fig:tempfit_map_vs_res1}-\ref{fig:tempfit_map_vs_res3}, we show a comparison between the original data (left columns) and the template cleaned maps (right columns). Clearly, the template fitting performs well on all frequencies, leaving residual signals that are associated with high-activity regions of the Milky Way (especially evident in the 857 GHz and 3000 GHz residuals), as well as unmodelled zodiacal emission from the Solar System (evident in the two highest frequency maps). Overall, a by-eye survey seems to indicate that the template fitting is an efficient procedure for accounting for most of the dust.

In order to quantify the degree to which this impression bears out in practice, in Fig. \ref{fig:temprms} we construct a measure of the amount of signal that is ``explained'' by the template fit. It is constructed by taking the RMS of the pixel values in the original map, as well as those of the residual map after template subtraction, and subtracting these values from each other, normalizing the value by the original RMS. We see that the fraction of unexplained RMS left in the map ranges from about 2\% (for the lower frequencies) to around 15\%, and we note that the only two maps that have more than 5\% of unexplained RMS are the two maps where the imprint of remaining zodiacal light is the strongest.
