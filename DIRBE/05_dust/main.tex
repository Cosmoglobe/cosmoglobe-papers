   \abstract{We present a three-component model of thermal dust emission in the combined DIRBE and Planck HFI frequency range. The three components correspond respectively to cold, hot, and near-by dust. All three components are modelled with spatially constant spectral energy density (SED) parameters, but with a spatially varying amplitude. However, the near-by dust component is additionally strongly constrained by  the GAIA-based 3D model of Edenhofer which provides a template of thermal dust emission closer than 1.25\,kpc from the Sun. Each pixel has therefore only two freely fitted degrees of freedom, and this model is fitted to a set of 12 independent frequency channels between 100\,GHz to 25\,$\mu$m. The original motivation for considering such a highly constrained model was to facilitate deep searches for extragalactic background fluctuations in DIRBE, for which minimizing degeneracies between extragalactic and Galactic signals is key. However, and despite its algorithmic motivation, we find that the model provides a surprisingly good fit on large angular scales, with more than 90\,\% of the sky being dominated by non-Galactic residuals (zodiacal light, cosmic infrared background fluctuations, and instrumental noise) at channels as different as Planck 100 and 857\,GHz and DIRBE 240 and 25\,$\mu$m. Perhaps even more strikingly, we also find that the amplitude maps corresponding to the cold and hot dust components correlate spatially very strongly with external $H_I$ and $C_{II}$ templates, respectively. Thus, the model appears not only to provide a compact numerical representation of thermal dust emission in the Milky Way, but it also seems to represent a key aspect the true underlying physics. This observation may also have important consequences for future CMB $B$-mode polarization studies, for which thermal dust emission is the single most important astrophysical contaminant. }
