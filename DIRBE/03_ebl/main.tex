  \abstract{We present new constraints on the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and Cosmic Optical Background (COB) as part of the \Cosmoglobe\ DR2 reanalysis of COBE-DIRBE. We derive a sky model from 100\,GHz to $1.25\,\mathrm{\mu m}$, including thermal dust, PAH emission, CO and \textsc{C\,ii} emission lines, zodiacal light, and stars. Using \Planck\ HFI, FIRAS, and DIRBE maps, we fit for these components. When removing these effects, the remaining sky signal in DIRBE includes monopoles at 3.5, 4.9, 60, 100, 140, 240\,$\mathrm{\mu m}$ that are consistent with the expected amplitude from the COB and CIB. In addition, we find fluctuations in the $100$ and $240\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ map that are correlated in harmonic space with the \Planck\ 857\,GHz GNILC CIB fluctuations. The detections of CIB monopoles and fluctuations in 100 and 240\,$\mathrm{\mu m}$ give direct estimates of $\Delta T/T=1\,\%$.

\section{Introduction}

Got it. All thanks to improved \citet{K98}.


\section{Theory}

What sort of backgrounds do we expect? What populations are being probed? What is $\Delta T/T(\nu)$?

Overview of FIRAS monopole detection, stacking analyses, etc. Limits on monopole, fluctuations.

\subsection{Comparison with previous methods}

DIRBE was designed to detect the CIB, but the high amplitude of zodiacal light emission posed problems. As shown in \citet{san:2024b}, zodiacal light residuals in the DIRBE maps have been reduced by a factor of three in most bands using a joint analysis with a fairly restrictive model.

As shown in \citet{san:2024a}, the residuals at the $100\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ and $240\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ have well-understood noise properties, which residuals that correlate with the GNILC \citet{gnilc} CIB maps at 857\,GHz with $\rho=0.5\pm0.1$ at $\ell\sim200$. Much of this can be understood by using external \Planck\ HFI data to generate the sky model. 

Furthermore, using the FIRAS absolutely calibrated data, we are able to ascertain the absolute zero level in both the FIRAS bands and also the DIRBE bands. At bands 60, 100, 140, and 240 $\mathrm{\mu m}$, we have confirmed the monopole to have an amplitude consistent with theoretical expectations \citep{finke2022}. At bands 12 and 25 $\mathrm{\mu m}$, zodiacal emission is brightest, so despite improving the official DIRBE ZSMA monopoles by a factor of three, the monoopoles here are clearly still dominated by zodiacal residuals. Bands 1.25, 2.2, 3.5, and 4.9 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ are closest, but here the emission is dominated by stars, many of which are fully unresolved. \citet{san:2024a} performed an analysis assuming each star is a modified blackbody, but this can certainly be improved by the physical parameters delivered by \textit{Gaia}.

\section{Conclusions}

This is the first time that CIB fluctuations have been detected in DIRBE, and the first time that fluctuations and monopoles have been detected in the same band.

As demonstrated here, the limitation in fully modeling the CIB has been the inability to properly utilize external data. In this work, the reanalysis of DIRBE data was made much simpler not only by the large increase of relative computing power with respect to dataset size, but also the information gained by using a global sky model spanning from $100\,\mathrm{GHz}$ to $1\,\mathrm{\mu m}$.

Much of this work is made possible through the use of archival time-ordered data with complementary scan strategies, frequency coverage, detector technologies, and observation time. In the case of CIB studies, the interplay between foregrounds, namely zodiacal and Galactic dust, has limited previous detections. In future work, additional data will further break these degeneracies, and the potential to further understand the astrophysical signals in these datasets will be improved. In particular, the \textit{Infrared Astrophysical Observatory} (\textit{IRAS}) created nearly full-sky maps at 12, 25, 60, and 100 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ with resolution between 0.5 arcmin to 2 arcmin. A full end-to-end joint analysis of \textit{IRAS} and DIRBE will leverage the unique properties of both datsets, and enable an even deeper view of the CIB in the tens of microns.
