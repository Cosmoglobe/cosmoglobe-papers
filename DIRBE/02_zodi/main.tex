\section{Introduction}
Zodiacal light (ZL, sometimes zodiacal emission or interplanetary dust emission) is the primary source of diffuse radiation observed in the infrared sky between 1-100 $\mu$m (\cite{leinert1998} and references therein). The light comes from scattering and re-emission of sunlight from interplanetary dust (IPD) grains. ZL is usually the most difficult source of foreground contamination to remove in studies of the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) due to its seasonal nature. As such, a big part of the infrared sky has been inaccessible to cosmological analysis, due to difficulties with ZL modeling. Improving our models of the interplanetary medium is on of the most crucial steps for large scale detections of the EBL.

Existing ZL model typically consists of a three-dimensional model for the IPD distribution in the Solar system, along with a description of the ZL brightness through the radiative and scattering properties of the IPD. The ZL observed by an instrument is then computed by evaluating the brightness along each observed line-of-sight. The state-of-the-art ZL model is the field of cosmology is the Kelsall et al. 1998\citep{K98} (K98), which was built by the DIRBE team for the purpose of removing ZL from their data in the late 1900s. Since then, our understanding of the infrared sky has improved drastically with experiments such as Planck HFI, Gaia, and WISE, giving us access to far superior sky models. These new models, along with computational advances in Bayesian cosmological analysis \citep{BP2023, Galloway2023, Watts2023}, complimentary data in the infrared, and more compute power allows us to extract much more information about the true nature of the interplanetary medium from the DIRBE data then what was possible for the DIRBE team at the time.

In this paper we present the ZL modelling efforts in the \Cosmoglobe\ DR2 release. In Sect. 2, we give a brief overview of the ZL model and its implementation in Commander. In Sect. 3 we discuss sampling of ZL models and present new novel techniques. In Sect. 4 we present the new state-of-the-art ZL model obtained, which is a re-stimation of the the parameters in the K98 model with some additional modification, along with preliminary results from more comprehensive modifications to the ZL models achieved by generalizing the K98 model and incorporating various features from the Rowan-Robinson and May 2013 (RRM) model. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results and the future of ZL modeling in the \Cosmoglobe\ framework, with suggestions for better ZL modelling and which data sets to include in future studies.

\section{Zodiacal light modelling in Commander}
\subsection{Parameterization the interplanetary dust distribution}
The IPD distribution in the Zodiacal cloud is both smooth and stable. However, fine structures are produced within the smooth cloud from asteroidal collisions, cometary trails, and gravitational resonance in the orbit of the planets. The number density $n(x,y,z)$ of the total IPD at some heliocentric ecliptic position $(x, y, x)$ can therefore be described as the sum of several spatially distinct IPD distributions. Each distinct distribution is called a zodiacal component, denoted by $c$. These components do not necessarily share a plane of symmetry with the smooth cloud. We therefore allow them to have an offset from the Sun $(x_{0,c}, y_{0,c}, z_{0,c})$ such that the component-centric coordinates become
\begin{equation}    
    \begin{aligned}
        x_c&= x - x_{0,c}\\
        y_c&= y - y_{0,c}\\
        z_c&= z - z_{0,c}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Similarly, the tilt and orientation of a zodiacal components symmetry plane can be described by its inclination $i_c$ and ascending node $\Omega_c$. In the these coordinates, the density of a zodiacal component is fully described by the radial distance from its origin $r_c$, and the height above the symmetry plane $Z_c$
\begin{align}
    r_c &= \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2 + z_c^2},\\
    Z_c &= x_c\sin{\Omega_c}\sin{i_c} - y_c \cos{\Omega_c}\sin{i_c} + z_c \cos{i_c}.
\end{align}


\subsection{Reference models}
\subsubsection{DIRBE/Kelsall (K98)}
The K98 model consists of the following zodiacal components: 1) The diffuse cloud, representing the smooth component of the zodiacal cloud; 2) Three asteroidal dust bands; 3) The circum-solar ring, representing the dust trapped in the orbit of the Earth. In the region trailing the Earth, an enhancement is included in this ring known as the Earth-trailing feature. The parametrization of these components are listed below where $n_\mathrm{C}$, $n_{\mathrm{B}_i}$, $n_\mathrm{R}$ are the number densities of the diffuse cloud, asteroidal dust bands, and the circum-solar ring, respectively. 
\begin{equation}
    n_\mathrm{C}(x,y,z)=n_{0, \mathrm{C}}r_\mathrm{C}^{-\alpha}f(\zeta_\mathrm{C}),
\end{equation}
\begin{align}
    n_{\mathrm{B}_i}(x,y,z) &= \frac{3 n_{0, \mathrm{B}_i}}{r_{\mathrm{B}_i}} \exp \left[-\left(\frac{\zeta_{\mathrm{B}_i}}{\delta_{\zeta_{\mathrm{B}_i}}}\right)^{6}\right]\left[1 + \left(\frac{\zeta_{\mathrm{B}_i}}{\delta_{\zeta_{\mathrm{B}_i}}}\right)^{p}v^{-1}\right] \\
    &\times\left\{1-\exp \left[-\left(\frac{r_{\mathrm{B}_i}}{\delta_{r_{\mathrm{B}_i}}}\right)^{20}\right]\right\},
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    n_\mathrm{R}(x, y, z, \theta)&=n_{0, \mathrm{SR}} \exp \left[-\frac{\left(r_\mathrm{R}-r_{0, \mathrm{SR}}\right)^2}{\sigma_{R,\mathrm{SR}} ^2}-\frac{\left| Z_\mathrm{R} \right|}{\sigma_{Z, \mathrm{SR}}}\right],\\
   &+ n_{0, \mathrm{TF}} \exp \left[-\frac{\left(r_\mathrm{R}-r_{0, \mathrm{TF}}\right)^{2}}{\sigma_{R, \mathrm{TF}}^{2}}-\frac{\left|Z_\mathrm{F}\right|}{\sigma_{Z, \mathrm{TF}}}-\frac{\left(\theta-\theta_{0, \mathrm{TF}}\right)^{2}}{\sigma_{\theta,\mathrm{TF}}^{2}}\right].
\end{align}
\subsubsection{Rowan-Robinson and May (RRM)}
The Rowan-Robinson model\citep{RRM} is a recent more physically motivated IPD model. It features the a fan component which represents the diffuse IPD distribution up until the orbit of mars, and then a cometary component which represents the diffuse IPD distribution beyond the orbit of Mars and until the asteroid belt. The model has asteroidal bands similar to K98, but in the RRM model they come in two categories: One pair of broad bands, and two narrow bands. The RRM model also includes a contribution from uniformly distributed interstellar dust.
Rather than using $Z_c$, the height above the symmetry plane, the RRM parametrization uses $\beta_c = \arcsin |Z_c/r_c|$. The parametrization of the RRM model is as follows

\begin{equation}
    n_\mathrm{F}(x,y,z)=n_{0, \mathrm{F}}r_\mathrm{F}^{-\gamma}f(\beta_0),
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
    f(\beta_0) = \exp\left[-P|\sin \beta_0| \right].
\end{equation}

\subsection{Radiative and scattering properties}
The IPD grains are assumed to emit thermal emission on the form of a blackbody modified by an emissivity factor $E_{c, \lambda}$
\begin{equation}
    I^\mathrm{Thermal}_{c,\lambda} = E_{c,\lambda} B_\lambda(T).
\end{equation}
where $B_\lambda(T)$ is the Planck function. The temperature $T$ of the IPD is assumed to fall off with radial distance from the Sun $r$ on the form
\begin{equation}
    T(r) = T_0 R^{-\delta},
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is the power law index which is $0.5$ for theoretical gray dust.

At wavelengths where $\lambda \sim$ the grain size, the sunlight will be scattered instead of absorbed by the IPD. The scattered 

The scattered light is described by the solar flux $F_\lambda^\odot$, the phase function $\Phi_\lambda(\Theta)$ representing the probability of a photon being scattered at an angle $\Theta$, and the reflectivity or albedo $A_{c, \lambda}$ of the dust grains
\begin{equation}\label{eq: scat_term}
    I^\mathrm{Scattering}_{c, \lambda} = A_{c, \lambda} F_\lambda^\odot(R) \Phi_\lambda(\Theta).
\end{equation}
We refer to \cite{ZODIPY} for a more details. The total intensity from the zodiacal light is then the sum of the scattered and thermal emission
\begin{align}
    I^\mathrm{Total}_{c, \lambda} &= I^\mathrm{Scattering}_{c,\lambda} + I^\mathrm{Thermal}_{c,\lambda}\\
    &= A_{c, \lambda} F_\lambda^\odot(R) \Phi_\lambda(\Theta) + \left( 1 - A_{c, \lambda} \right) E_{c,\lambda} B_\lambda(T(R)).
\end{align}

\subsection{Line-of-sight integrals}
When evaluating the zodiacal emission at a time $t$ we integrating along a line-of-sight $ds$ from the observer towards the observed pixel $p$
\begin{equation}\label{eq: intensity}
    I_{p,t} = \sum_c \int n_c \left[  A_{c, \lambda} F_\lambda^\odot \Phi_\lambda + \left( 1 - A_{c, \lambda} \right) E_{c,\lambda} B_\lambda \right]\,\mathrm {ds},
\end{equation}
\subsection{Geocentric stationary zodiacal light}
The circumsolar-ring and Earth-trailing feature are by definition distributed with respect to the Earth. In an Earth-centric, or geocentric, reference frame, the signal from such components will be stationary on the sky, if these are infact perfectly following the Earth around in the orbit. 
We can therefore make a geocentric map of the full survey, where we have subtracted away the sky model in addition to the diffuse cloud and the asteroidal dust bands. What we are left with is the static zodiacal emission coming from the circumsolar ring and the Earth-trailing feature and other potential earth centric interplanetary dust. 
This map can then be used as a lookup map for the combined emission from the circumsolar ring and the Earth-trailing feature components. The projection of the signal from this map to the timestream at a DIRBE frequency $\nu$, at a pixel $p$ in galactic coordinates, and at at a time $t$ is then a matter of a simple lookup
\begin{equation}
    S_{\nu, t, p}^{\mathrm{Ring + Feature}} = M^{\bigoplus}_{\nu, p'},
\end{equation}
where $M^{\bigoplus}_{\nu, p'}$ is the geocentric lookup map and $p'$ is the corresponding pixel index in the geocentric reference frame. An example of such a map is shown in figure \ref{fig: geomap}.

% \section{Introduction}
% Zodiacal light (ZL, sometimes zodiacal emission or interplanetary dust emission) is the primary source of diffuse radiation observed in the infrared sky between 1-100 $\mu$m (\cite{leinert1998} and references therein). The light comes from scattering and re-emission of sunlight from interplanetary dust grains. ZL has been the most problematic source of foreground contamination in studies of the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) the infrared sky due, mainly due to its time-varying nature. Improving our understanding of the interplanetary medium and building better ZL models is arguably the most critical step in making a large part of the infrared sky accessible to cosmological analysis. 

% The current state-of-the-art ZL model is the Kelsall et al. 1998 (K98), which was developed by the DIRBE team for the purpose of removing ZL from their data. It consists of a parametric three-dimensional model of the interplanetary dust distribution with several distinguishable components such as 
% These components were assumed to emit like modified blackbodies and could be evaluated through line-of-sight integrations to simulate the observed zodiacal light. 


% Ever since it was first understood in the 17th century \citep{cassini}, zodiacal light has been a driving force for the exploration of the interplanetary medium. The Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) instrument, onboard the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), found that the zodiacal light could be effectively characterized in the infrared \citep{mather:1994, hauser:1998}. The DIRBE team developed a geometric model that represented the interplanetary medium and its identifiable components.
% These components were assumed to emit like modified blackbodies and could be evaluated through line-of-sight integrations to simulate the observed zodiacal light. This model, detailed in \cite{K98}, (here-after K98), has demonstrated its effectiveness in describing zodiacal light in the infrared and sub-millimeter domains and has been the default modeling used in the cosmology community for the past twenty years. The Planck Collaboration \citep{PLANCK2013, PLANCK2015, PLANCK2018} recently utilized the DIRBE model in their analysis of the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) data. They adapted the model to be applicable at sub-terahertz frequencies by evaluating the K98 model with the HFI scanning strategy and fitting an overall amplitude to model components.

% The ZL is considered a local foreground in CMB studies with the emission originating from the near vicinity of the observer. This is a contrast to more common foregrounds such as the CMB and galactic thermal dust emission, which we assume to be stationary in the sky. Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds can be modeled with a single template describing the structure of the component at some reference frequency. The template can then be scaled to arbitrary frequencies given a description of the component's spectral energy density (SED). Simple models like this does not apply to the zodiacal light, which highly depends on the position and time of observation.
% It is impossible to describe and model the zodiacal light foreground through a single template, applicable to all experiments. Instead, the zodiacal light must be dynamically modeled on a per-experiment basis taking into account the position of the observer within the solar system and the scanning strategy. 

% The main highlight of this work is that we are able to produce a better zodiacal light model with much smaller residuals in the frequency maps using only the same zodiacal light-contaminated data used by the DIRBE team in their original analysis. We attribute most of this success to the Cosmoglobe effort of joint global Bayesian analysis of the time-ordered DIRBE data along with maps and point source catalogs from HFI, FIRAS, and WISE. This results in a much better constrained sky model than what was possible at the time of the original DIRBE analysis, making it easier to distinguish the zodiacal light from other signal sources. Additionally, when fitting the zodiacal light model parameters, the DIRBE team used week maps differenced by the full survey sky map. While this removes all static signals from the sky, it also kills much of the effective signal-to-noise ratio for both zodiacal light parameters and the zero levels. In the Cosmoglobe approach, we fit all zodiacal light parameters directly to the timestreams, making it easier to resolve the degeneracies of the geometric interplanetary dust parameters. 

% This goes to show that even when only using archival data, it is possible to create more robust descriptions of the interplanetary medium and the observed zodiacal light. In coming Cosmoglobe data releases we will include more zodiacal light-contaminated time-ordered data from experiments such as AKARI and IRAS, which will help break many of the geometric parameter degeneracies in the interplanetary dust model due to the complimentary scanning strategies of the respective experiments.

% In this paper, we will detail the zodiacal light modeling approach used in the Commander framework during the production of Cosmoglobe DR2. Furthermore, the perhaps greatest result from this works comes from the fitting of the model parameters from a Bayesian perspective, utilizing all DIRBE bands jointly along with HFI, FIRAS and WISE data to produce the best zodiacal light model of the infrared sky. 
% In Sect. 2 we describe zodiacal light model in terms of the interplanetary dust models, source functions, and line-of-sight integrations. 
% Additionally, introduce and interpret the zodiacal light in the DIRBE time-ordered data. Finally we discuss the sampling techniques used to fit the many zodiacal light model parameters from a Bayesian perspective. In Sect. 3 we reanalyze the DIRBE data using the K98 model as derived by the DIRBE team, and see that we recover their results. 
% In Sect. 4 we explore extensions to the K98 model by lifting some of the constraints set on the model parameter by the DIRBE team, and including some of the more physical descriptions of the zodiacal components from \cite{RRM}. These extended models are referred to as model A and B, where model A is the relaxed K98 model, while model B is a more complex model with additional modifications.


% \section{Modeling zodiacal light in the DIRBE data}
% Introduction to the foreground and why it differs from typical CMB foregrounds with time-variations. More or less a copy of \cite{ZODIPY} section 3

% \subsection{Zodiacal light models}
% The zodiacal light models we use are two-fold. The first part considers the three-dimensional parameteric description of how the interplanetary dust is distributed in the solar system, consisting of several zodiacal components. The second part of the model considers the emission mechanisms of the dust. 
% The three-dimensional model is defined in cartesian heliocentric coordinates $(x, y, z)$ with each zodiacal component $c$ being allowed to have an offset from the sun $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$. The component-centric coordinates are then
% \begin{equation}    
%     \begin{aligned}
%         x_c&= x - x_{0,c}\\
%         y_c&= y - y_{0,c}\\
%         z_c&= z - z_{0,c}.
%     \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}
% Additionally, each component is allowed to have its own symmetry-plane described by the inclination $i$ and the ascending node $\Omega$. 
% In the component-centric coordinates we can then describe the full density distribution of the component $n_c(r_c, z_c)$ with the two parameters $r_c$ and $z_c$
% \begin{align}
%     r_c &= \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2 + z_c^2}\\
%     z_c &= x_c\sin{\Omega_c}\sin{i_c} - y_c \cos{\Omega_c}\sin{i_c} + z_c \cos{i_c},
% \end{align}
% where $r_c$ is the radial distance from the components center $(x_{0,c}, y_{0,c}, z_{0,c})$ and $z_c$ height above the symmetry plane. Note that all distances are in units of AU.


% \subsection{Emission mechanisms}
% We assume that the thermal emission from the interplanetary dust grains are on the form of a blackbody modified by an emissivity factor $E_{c, \lambda}$
% \begin{equation}
%     I^\mathrm{Thermal}_{c,\lambda} = E_{c,\lambda} B_\lambda(T).
% \end{equation}
% where $B_\lambda(T)$ is the Planck function with the temperature $T$ given by the heliocentric distance from the sun $r$
% \begin{equation}
%     T(r) = T_0 R^{-\delta},
% \end{equation}
% where $\delta$ describes how the temperature decreases with distance from the sun.

% The scattered light is described by the solar flux $F_\lambda^\odot$, the phase function $\Phi_\lambda(\Theta)$ representing the probability of a photon being scattered at an angle $\Theta$, and the reflectivity or albedo $A_{c, \lambda}$ of the dust grains
% \begin{equation}\label{eq: scat_term}
%     I^\mathrm{Scattering}_{c, \lambda} = A_{c, \lambda} F_\lambda^\odot(R) \Phi_\lambda(\Theta).
% \end{equation}
% We refer to \cite{ZODIPY} for a more details. The total intensity from the zodiacal light is then the sum of the scattered and thermal emission
% \begin{align}
%     I^\mathrm{Total}_{c, \lambda} &= I^\mathrm{Scattering}_{c,\lambda} + I^\mathrm{Thermal}_{c,\lambda}\\
%     &= A_{c, \lambda} F_\lambda^\odot(R) \Phi_\lambda(\Theta) + \left( 1 - A_{c, \lambda} \right) E_{c,\lambda} B_\lambda(T(R)).
% \end{align}

% \subsection{Line-of-sight integration}
% When evaluating the zodiacal emission at a time $t$ we integrating along a line-of-sight $ds$ from the observer towards the observed pixel $p$
% \begin{equation}\label{eq: intensity}
%     I_{p,t} = \sum_c \int n_c \left[  A_{c, \lambda} F_\lambda^\odot \Phi_\lambda + \left( 1 - A_{c, \lambda} \right) E_{c,\lambda} B_\lambda \right]\,\mathrm ds,
% \end{equation}

% \subsection{Novel techniques for zodiacal light modelling}
% \subsubsection{Geocentric static zodiacal emission}
% The circumsolar-ring and Earth-trailing feature are by definition distributed with respect to the Earth. In an Earth-centric, or geocentric, reference frame, the signal from such components will be stationary on the sky, if these are infact perfectly following the Earth around in the orbit. 
% We can therefore make a geocentric map of the full survey, where we have subtracted away the sky model in addition to the diffuse cloud and the asteroidal dust bands. What we are left with is the static zodiacal emission coming from the circumsolar ring and the Earth-trailing feature and other potential earth centric interplanetary dust. 
% This map can then be used as a lookup map for the combined emission from the circumsolar ring and the Earth-trailing feature components. The projection of the signal from this map to the timestream at a DIRBE frequency $\nu$, at a pixel $p$ in galactic coordinates, and at at a time $t$ is then a matter of a simple lookup
% \begin{equation}
%     S_{\nu, t, p}^{\mathrm{Ring + Feature}} = M^{\bigoplus}_{\nu, p'},
% \end{equation}
% where $M^{\bigoplus}_{\nu, p'}$ is the geocentric lookup map and $p'$ is the corresponding pixel index in the geocentric reference frame. An example of such a map is shown in figure \ref{fig: geomap}.

% \begin{figure}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/zodi_static.pdf}
%     \caption{Geocentric map $M^{\bigoplus}_\nu$ of the full survey, where we have subtracted away the sky model in addition to the diffuse cloud and the asteroidal dust bands.

% \section{Reference models}
% Below is a brief overview of the six zodiacal components in the K98 and RRM models. For a more detailed description of the components, see \cite{K98} and \cite{RRM}.
% \subsection{DIRBE/Kelsall (K98) model}
% The K98 model includes six zodiacal components. For a visual representation of the components, see Figure 1 and 2 in \cite{ZODIPY}. 

% \subsubsection{The diffuse cloud}
% The diffuse cloud is the primary source of interplanetary dust in the model and is a cloud-like distribution of dust that encapsulates most of the inner solar system. 
% The density of the cloud is described on a seperable form with a radial and a vertical component motived by the Pointing-Robertson effect
% \begin{equation}
%     n_\mathrm{C}(r_\mathrm{C}, z_\mathrm{C}) = n_{0,\mathrm{C}} r_\mathrm{C}^{-\alpha} f(\zeta_\mathrm{C}),
% \end{equation}
% where 
% \begin{equation}
%     f(\zeta) = \exp \left(-\beta g^{\gamma} \right),
% \end{equation}
% and $\zeta \equiv |z_c|/r_c$, $g$ is
% \begin{equation}
%     g = \begin{cases}
%         \zeta^2/2\mu, & \text{for } \zeta < \mu\\
%         \zeta - \mu/2, & \text{for } \zeta \geq \mu,
%     \end{cases}
% \end{equation}
% where $\mu$, $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are all shape parameters.

% \subsubsection{Asteroidal dust bands}
% The K98 model includes three asteroidal dust band pairs, each associated with a different asteroidal family. 
% The bands are described as a sum of two Gaussian distributions in the radial and vertical direction
% \begin{equation}
%     \begin{aligned}
%         n_{\mathrm{B}_j}(r_{\mathrm{B}_j}, z_{\mathrm{B}_j})=& \frac{3 n_{0, \mathrm{B}_j}}{r_{\mathrm{B}_j}} \exp \left[-\left(\frac{\zeta_{\mathrm{B}_j}}{\delta_{\zeta_{\mathrm B_j}}}\right)^{6}\right]\left[1 + \left(\frac{\zeta_{\mathrm{B}_j}}{\delta_{\zeta_{\mathrm{B}_j}}}\right)^{p_{\mathrm{B}_j}}v^{-1}_{\mathrm{B}_j}\right] \\
%         & \times\left\{1-\exp \left[-\left(\frac{r_{\mathrm{B}_j}}{\delta_{r_{\mathrm{B}_j}}}\right)^{20}\right]\right\},
%     \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}
% \subsubsection{Circumsolar ring and Earth-trailing feature}
% The circumsolar ring and Earth-trailing feature are two components that are associated with the Earth's orbit around the sun. 
% The circumsolar ring is a toroidal distribution of dust that is centered around the sun, while the Earth-trailing is an enhancement to this distribution in the region that trails the Earth.
% \begin{equation}\label{eq: ring}
%     n_\mathrm{R}(r_\mathrm{R}, z_\mathrm{R})=n_{\mathrm{R},0} \exp \left[-\frac{\left(r_\mathrm{R}-r_{0, \mathrm{R}}\right)^2}{\sigma_{\mathrm{R}, r} ^2}-\frac{\left| z_\mathrm{R} \right|}{\sigma_{\mathrm{R}, z}}\right],
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}\label{eq: feature}
%    n_\mathrm{F}(r_\mathrm{F}, z_\mathrm{F}, \theta_\mathrm{F}) = n_{\mathrm{F}, 0} \exp \left[-\frac{\left(r_\mathrm{F}-r_{\mathrm{F}, 0}\right)^{2}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{F}, r}^{2}}-\frac{\left|z_\mathrm{F}\right|}{\sigma_{\mathrm{F}, z}}-\frac{\left(\theta_\mathrm{F}-\theta_{\mathrm{F}, 0}\right)^{2}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{F}, \theta }^{2}}\right].
% \end{equation}
% The Earth-trailing feature is the only part of the zodiacal light model that is not symmetric in the solar system and requires the observer to input the angle $\theta_\mathrm{F}$ which describes the longitude of the Earth. Note that in K98 these two densities was joined to one single component.

% \subsection{Rowan-Robinson and May (RRM) model}
% In the RRM model, the components are described in terms of the radial distance from the component center $r_c$ and the the latitude above the symmetry-plane $\beta_0$. The transformation between the two angular and cartesian representations are given by $z_c = r_c \sin{\beta_0}$, 
% \begin{equation}
%     \beta_0 = \arctan\left(\frac{z_c}{r_c}\right).
% \end{equation}

% \subsubsection{The fan}
% The fan is the RRM equivalent of the diffuse cloud in the K98 model. The density of the fan is described in a separable form similar to the diffuse cloud
% \begin{equation}
%     n_{\mathrm{Fan}}\left(r_\mathrm{Fan}, \beta_0\right)=n_0 r_\mathrm{Fan}^{-\gamma} f\left(\beta_0\right),
% \end{equation}
% but the vertical distribution is rather given as 
% \begin{equation}
% f\left(\beta_0\right)=\left(\cos \beta_0\right)^Q \exp \left(-P \sin \left|\beta_0\right|^{\xi}\right),
% \end{equation}
% where
% \begin{equation}\ 
% \xi= \begin{cases}
%     2 - |z_{\mathrm{Fan}}/z_{\mathrm{Fan}, 0}| \mid & \text { for }|z_\mathrm{Fan}|<z_{\mathrm{Fan}, 0} \\     1 & \text { otherwise },
% \end{cases}
% \end{equation}
% Add more components if we use them.

The $\chi^2$ the minimizes minimize the total signal-minus-model residual, $I_{\nu}-Z_{\nu}$ (\emph{bottom right}).

% The approach we will use Gibbs sample each of the model parameters. This means that we propose a change to one model parameter, estimate the zodiacal emission over the full timestream of each ten DIRBE bands, compute a chi-squared and accept/reject. We perform N such proposals before we move on the the next parameter. Since the zodiacal emission is mostly very smooth on the sky, we can afford to downsample the TOD timestream before evaluating the zodiacal emission. For the diffuse cloud and the dust bands we downsample the TODS by X. For the circum-solar ring and the Earth-trailing feature, which are less smooth, and harder to constrain, we downsample the TODS by X. The downsampled TODS are subtracted by the \Cosmoglobe\ skymodel, and recomputed after after each parameter evaluation.
