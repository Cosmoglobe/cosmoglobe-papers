\abstract{We present the first Bayesian framework for global modelling 
of zodiacal light and its application to the Diffuse Infrared Background 
Experiment (DIRBE) time-ordered data (TOD). The framework uses a 
modified version of the COBE/DIRBE zodiacal light model to estimate the 
zodiacal light along the observed line-of-sights in the time domain. We 
obtain a new state-of-the-art zodiacal light model by re-estimating the 
free parameters in the COBE/DIRBE model and produce DIRBE zodiacal light 
subtracted mission average (ZSMA) maps with much smaller zodiacal light 
residuals. We argue that the improved zodiacal light model fit becomes 
possible through global Bayesian end-to-end analysis of the DIRBE TODs 
with COBE-FIRAS, GAIA, Planck HFI, and WISE observations, giving us a 
more accurate instrumental and astophysical characterization of the 
infrared sky. However, we do note that even though the zodiacal light 
model represent an improvement with respect to original DIRBE model when 
it comes to removing ZL from the DIRBE data, this is still a preliminary 
model. We illustrate the potential of this framework for building 
zodiacal models by conducting a small study where we further extend and 
modifcations to the zodiacal light model by adding more asteroidal 
bands, interstellar dust and using a more physically motivated 
parameterization of the interplanetary medium as described in

\section{Introduction}
Zodiacal light (ZL, sometimes zodiacal emission or interplanetary dust 
emission) is the primary source of diffuse radiation observed in the 
infrared sky between 1-100 $\mu$m (\cite{Leinert1998} and references 
therein). The light comes from scattering and re-emission of sunlight 
from interplanetary dust (IPD) grains. The inner Solar system is 
embedded in a sun-centered cloud of IPD, with a symmetry axis tilted 
slightly with respect to the Ecliptic, known as the zodiacal cloud. The 
ZL is seasonal, and its appearance in the sky changes as the Earth moves 
through the IPD distribution. The most common way to model the observer 
position-dependent ZL is to evaluate a line-of-sight integral for each 
observation directly in the time-ordered domain. The time-varying and 
three-dimensional nature of the ZL makes it one of the most challenging 
foregrounds to model in astrophysical and cosmological studies of the 
infrared sky. The lack of a good ZL model has left a vast portion of the 
electromagnetic spectrum inaccessible to cosmological analysis 
attempting to measure the Cosmic Optical and Infrared Backgrounds (COB, 
CIB). 

The state-of-the-art ZL model in the field of cosmology is the 
\cite{Kelsall1998} model (K98, sometimes referred to as the 
\textit{COBE}/DIRBE or just the DIRBE model). K98 is a parametric ZL 
model describing the three-dimensional IPD distribution and the 
radiative properties of the dust. The model was developed by the 
\textit{COBE}/DIRBE team to remove ZL from their data in the late 1900s.
 Since then, our understanding of the infrared sky has improved with new 
 observational data from experiments like Planck HFI, GAIA, and WISE. 
 Combining recent computational advances in Bayesian cosmological 
 analysis \citep{BP2023, Galloway2023, Watts2023}, more readily 
 available computing power and new complementary infrared datasets 
 allow us to extract significantly more information about the true 
 nature of the ZL from the DIRBE data than was possible at the time 
 of the original DIRBE analysis.

This paper is the second in a series of six describing the methods and 
results of our re-analysis of the time-ordered \textit{COBE}/DIRBE data 
within a global end-to-end Bayesian analysis framework. Here, we 
describe the ZL modeling approach in Commander3 and demonstrate the 
benefits of fitting a ZL model directly within a global end-to-end 
Bayesian framework. The basis of the newly implemented ZL module in 
Commander3 is ZodiPy \citep{San2024}, which is an Astropy-affiliated 
Python package for ZL simulations. The development of ZodiPy was 
motivated by two factors. It would serve as a basis for the code 
development in Commander3, and secondly, it would provide the 
astrophysical and cosmology communities with an accessible, easy-to-use 
interface to existing and coming ZL models. As an early application, 
\cite{San2022} demonstrates the removal of ZL from the DIRBE TOD with 
ZodiPy using the K98 model.

The following sections are organized as follows. In Sect.~\ref{sect:zodi-model}
, we introduce the K98 ZL model and discuss 
implementation details and some optimizations regarding evaluating ZL 
models on HEALPix grids. Next, in Sect.~\ref{sect:param-estimation}, we 
discuss ZL parameter estimation and our implementation, which involves 
the use of a function minimizer on a sub-sample of the DIRBE TOD. 
Finally, in Sect.~\ref{sect:improved-model}, we present a greatly 
improved ZL model, yielding lower residuals at all ten DIRBE channels. 
The improved model uses only a slightly different parametrization than 
the K98 model. We recommend using this model over K98 for all infrared 
community members.


\section{Zodiacal light modelling}\label{sect:zodi-model}
ZL is commonly removed directly from timestreams by performing 
line-of-sight integration at each observation through a parametric 
three-dimensional model of the IPD distribution. We use a slightly 
modified version of the K98 ZL model in Commander3. Below we present a 
short introduction to the model parametrization in terms of the 
three-dimensional IPD distribution and the radiative and scattering p
roperties of the IPD. We refer to~\cite{Kelsall1998} for a more detailed 
discussion about the ZL model.


\subsection{Parameterization of interplanetary dust}
The IPD in the zodiacal cloud is smooth and stable, and most of the dust 
is accounted for by a diffuse cloud-like component \citep{Leinert1998}. 
The majority of the dust in this cloud component stems from the 
mass-shedding of Jupiter family comets with low eccentricities and 
inclinations with respect to the ecliptic. However, fine structures 
within the zodiacal cloud exist as a result of collisions and 
fragmentation in asteroids and gravitational resonance in the orbit of 
planets \citep{Low1984, Dermott1984, Dermott1994, Reach1997}. 

We model the IPD distribution as a combination of several zodiacal 
components, denoted by $c$, each described by a heliocentric ecliptic 
number density $n_c(x,y,z)$. Each zodiacal component is allowed to have 
a heliocentric offset $(x_{0,c}, y_{0,c}, z_{0,c})$, such that the 
component-centric coordinates become
\begin{equation}    
    \begin{aligned}
        x_c&= x - x_{0,c}\\
        y_c&= y - y_{0,c}\\
        z_c&= z - z_{0,c}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Additionally, each zodiacal component is allowed to have a plane of 
symmetry different from the ecliptic, given by an inclination $i_c$ and 
ascending node $\Omega_c$. In component-centric coordinates, the number 
density is then fully described by the radial distance $r_c$ from the 
origin and the height above the symmetry plane $Z_c$
\begin{align}
    r_c &= \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2 + z_c^2},\\
    Z_c &= x_c\sin{\Omega_c}\sin{i_c} - y_c \cos{\Omega_c}\sin{i_c} + z_c \cos{i_c}.
\end{align}


\subsection{Zodiacal components}
\subsubsection{Smooth cloud}
The cloud component represents the smooth IPD distribution that embeds 
the inner Solar system. Its number density is modeled as
\begin{equation}
    n_\mathrm{C}(x,y,z)=n_{0, \mathrm{C}}r_\mathrm{C}^{-\alpha}f(\zeta_\mathrm{C}),
\end{equation}
where $n_{0, \mathrm{C}}$ is the number density at 1 AU, $\alpha$ is a 
power-law index, $f(\zeta_\mathrm{C})$ is the fan-like vertical 
distribution given as 
$f(\zeta_\mathrm{C}) = \exp {\left[-\beta g^\gamma \right]}$, where 
$\zeta_\mathrm{c} = |Z_\mathrm{c}|/r_\mathrm{c}$ is the radial height 
above the symmetry plane, 
\begin{equation}
    g = \begin{cases}
        \zeta^2/2\mu & \mathrm{for}\; \zeta < \mu,\\
        \zeta - \mu/2 & \mathrm{for}\; \zeta \geq \mu,
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
and  $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\mu$ are shape parameters.

\subsubsection{Dust bands}
Three dust bands are included in the model to represent the observed 
shoulder-like structure in the IRAS scans across the ecliptic plane. 
These bands appear at ecliptic latitudes of 
$\pm \sim 1.4^\circ$, $10^\circ$, and $15^\circ$, and are associated 
with the Themis, Koronis, and Eos asteroid families, respectively. Dust 
bands are modeled as
\begin{align}
    n_{\mathrm{B}_i}(x,y,z) &= \frac{3 n_{0, \mathrm{B}_i}}{r_{\mathrm{B}_i}} \exp \left[-\left(\frac{\zeta_{\mathrm{B}_i}}{\delta_{\zeta_{\mathrm{B}_i}}}\right)^{6}\right]\left[1 + \left(\frac{\zeta_{\mathrm{B}_i}}{\delta_{\zeta_{\mathrm{B}_i}}}\right)^{p}v^{-1}\right] \\
    &\times\left\{1-\exp \left[-\left(\frac{r_{\mathrm{B}_i}}{\delta_{r_{\mathrm{B}_i}}}\right)^{20}\right]\right\},
\end{align}
where $n_{0, \mathrm{B}_i}$ is the number density of band $\mathrm{B}_i$ 
at 3 AU, $\delta_{r_{\mathrm{B}_i}}$ is the inner radial cut-off, and 
$p$, $v$ and $\delta_{\zeta_{\mathrm{B}_i}}$ are shape parameters.
\subsubsection{Circum-solar ring and Earth-trailing feature}
A circum-solar ring component is included in the model to represent dust 
that has accumulated in Earth's orbit due to gravitational effects. This 
component also includes an enhancement to the IPD distribution at 
Earth's wake, known as the Earth-trailing feature. The ring component is 
modeled as
\begin{align}
    n_\mathrm{R}(x, y, z, \theta)&=n_{0, \mathrm{SR}} \exp \left[-\frac{\left(r_\mathrm{R}-r_{0, \mathrm{SR}}\right)^2}{\sigma_{R,\mathrm{SR}} ^2}-\frac{\left| Z_\mathrm{R} \right|}{\sigma_{Z, \mathrm{SR}}}\right],\\
   &+ n_{0, \mathrm{TF}} \exp \left[-\frac{\left(r_\mathrm{R}-r_{0, \mathrm{TF}}\right)^{2}}{\sigma_{R, \mathrm{TF}}^{2}}-\frac{\left|Z_\mathrm{F}\right|}{\sigma_{Z, \mathrm{TF}}}-\frac{\left(\theta-\theta_{0, \mathrm{TF}}\right)^{2}}{\sigma_{\theta,\mathrm{TF}}^{2}}\right],
\end{align}
where $\theta$ is the heliocentric longitude of the Earth, and the 
radial locations $r_{0, \mathrm{SR}}$, $r_{0, \mathrm{TF}}$ specifies 
the distances to the peak densities $n_{0, \mathrm{SR}}$, 
$n_{0, \mathrm{TF}}$. The $\sigma$ parameters are length scales for the 
$r$, $Z$ and $\theta$ parameters, respectively. Note that the 
Earth-trailing feature depends on the position of the Earth and does not 
have a plane symmetry like the other zodiacal components. 


\subsection{Radiative and scattering properties}
Thermal emission from IPD grains is modeled on the form of a blackbody
 modified by an emissivity factor $E_{c, \lambda}$
\begin{equation}
    I^\mathrm{Thermal}_{c,\lambda} = E_{c,\lambda} B_\lambda(T),
\end{equation}
where $B_\lambda$ is the Planck function at a wavelength $\lambda$. The 
temperature $T$ of the IPD falls off with radial distance $r$ from the 
Sun as
\begin{equation}
    T(r) = T_0 r^{-\delta},
\end{equation}
where $T_0$ is the temperature of IPD at 1 AU and $\delta$ the power law 
index. In addition to emitting thermally, IPD grains also scatter 
sunlight in the near-infrared. The contribution to the total signal from 
scattering is modeled as
\begin{equation}\label{eq: scat_term}
    I^\mathrm{Scattering}_{c, \lambda} = A_{c, \lambda} F_\lambda^\odot(r) \Phi_\lambda(\Theta),
\end{equation}
where $A_{c, \lambda}$ is the albedo, or reflectivity of the IPD of a 
given zodiacal component, $F_\lambda^\odot(r)$ the solar flux at a 
radial distance from the Sun, and $\Phi_\lambda(\Theta)$ is the phase 
function for scattering angles $\Theta$, which describes the angular 
distribution of the scattered light.

The total intensity from a single IPD grain is
\begin{align}\label{eq:I_tot}
    I^\mathrm{Total}_{c, \lambda} &= I^\mathrm{Scattering}_{c,\lambda} + I^\mathrm{Thermal}_{c,\lambda}\\
    &= A_{c, \lambda} F_\lambda^\odot \Phi_\lambda + E_{c,\lambda} B_\lambda.
\end{align}

\subsection{Evaluating the zodiacal model}
The ZL model is evaluated by solving the following line-of-sight 
integral for each observation in the timestream
\begin{equation}\label{eq:los}
    I_{p,t} = \sum_c \int n_c \left[  A_{c, \lambda} F_\lambda^\odot \Phi_\lambda + \left( 1 - A_{c, \lambda} \right) E_{c,\lambda} B_\lambda \right]\,\mathrm {ds}.
\end{equation}
Here, $p$ is a point in the sky, $t$ is the time of observation, and ds 
is a small distance along the line-of-sight $s$ from the observer and 
towards $p$, and $n_c$ is the number density of component $c$ in the 
line-of-sight. Note that there is a factor (1 - $A_{c, \lambda}$) 
difference between equation~\eqref{eq:los} and~\eqref{eq:I_tot}. This 
factor represents a form of extinction where thermal emission is 
sometimes scattered away from the line-of-sight. 


\subsection{Optimizing model evaluations}\label{sect:optimization}
The line-of-sight evaluations are an expensive part of the analysis 
pipeline and significantly increase the time that it takes to complete a 
single Gibbs sample. Additionally, when estimating ZL parameters we need 
to make a pass over the entire data set for each proposal. The DIRBE 
data set is very light when compared with modern observations, meaning 
that we can get away with some additional computational time. But for 
future data releases with AKARI or SPHEREx data, this will become 
computationally unfeasible. As such, we have implemented a few 
optimizations regarding ZL evaluation. 
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/cache_error_delta_t.pdf}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/cache_error_z.pdf}
    \caption{\textit{(top):} Difference between two instantaneous views 
    of the ZL separated by 2 hours. \textit{(bottom):} Difference 
    between an instantaneous view of the ZL from 900 km above Earth's 
    north pole and one from 900km below Earth's south pole.}    
    \label{fig:cache-error}
\end{figure}
The main optimization comes from the implementation of a ZL cache. The 
cache takes advantage of the smoothly varying nature of the ZL, and lets 
us reuse computed ZL estimates for proximate re-observations. 
Internally, Commander3 works with instrument pointing on the form of 
discrete pixel indices, meaning that re-observerations of a given pixel, 
within a short timeframe $\Delta t$, can be reused
\begin{equation}
    s_\mathrm{zodi}(p, t_i) = s_\mathrm{zodi}(p, t_j).
\end{equation}
The error induces from this cache is directly proportional to the 
distance that the observer has moved through the $\Delta t$ parameter. 
As a reference, the ZL moves by about $1^\circ$ on the sky each day as 
the Earth orbits the Sun. In addition to the positional change along 
Earth's orbit, the COBE satellite also orbits the Earth at an altitude 
of 900 km. This motion is lost when using the cache. These magnitude of 
the error induced by the cache is illustrated in 
Figure~\ref{fig:cache-error}.  We found that resetting the cache every 
2 hours resulted in a good compromise between speed and accuracy. Note 
that a cache on this form is only efficient for experiments with scanning 
strategies with partially overlapping subsequent scans. The magnitude of
the errors are well below the the residuals, justifying the use of the 
cache.

The smooth nature of the ZL can be exploited in more ways. When sampling 
ZL parameters is is possible to use a subsample of the full TOD while 
still resolving the smooth ZL structure. In our analysis we have used a 
thinning factor of 8 meaning that we fit the data to a timestream with 1 
Hz. Another optimization comes in form of spatial downsampling, where 
the smoothness of the ZL is resolved adequatly at a HEALPix resolution 
of $n_\mathrm{SIDE} = 64$ down from the original 512, further reducing 
the volume of the data used in the fits by a factor of 64. The 
downsampling is simulated by projecting all the original pointing to the 
lower HEALPix resolution, and using a corresponding low-res cache.


\section{Bayesian parameter estimation of zodiacal light parameters}\label{sect:param-estimation}
\subsection{Parameter atlas}
The K98 ZL model contains around 50 parameters to describe the 
three-dimensional IPD distribution and another 30 or more to describe 
the thermal emission and scattered sunlight source functions. Around 50 
of these were fit to the DIRBE data, while the rest were held fixed. To 
illustrate how each parameter influences the final mission averaged ZL 
map, we have produced a so-called ZL parameter atlas, which can be seen 
in figures~\ref{fig:atlas1} and~\ref{fig:atlas2}. Each map in the atlas 
shows the effects of changing a single ZL parameter by $\pm 5\%$. The 
albedo and emissivity parameters are excluded from the atlas as these 
represent a direct scaling of the component maps and are degenerate with 
the $n_0$ maps. The number associated with each map is the scaling 
factor applied to each map to get them on the same color scale. A small 
scale factor means that the parameter has a large effect on the total ZL 
amplitude.
\begin{figure*}

    represents a scaling factor mapping all maps to the same color 
    scale, and inicates how strongly (inversly proportional to the number) 
    the change to a given parameter affects the total ZL signal.}

    all maps to the same color scale, and inicates how strongly 
    (inversly proportional to the number) the change to a given 
    parameter affects the total ZL signal.}

    \caption{Illustration of the basic sky maps involved in the zodiacal 
    light fitting algorithms adopted by the DIRBE (\emph{left column}) 
    and \Cosmoglobe\ (\emph{right column}) pipelines for one week of 
    $25\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ observations and adopting the K98 model. The 
    DIRBE pipeline used exclusively differences between weekly and 
    full-season maps, both for the observed signal, 
    $\Delta I_{\nu} \equiv I_{\nu}-\left<I_{\nu}\right>$ (\emph{top left}), 
    and the zodiacal light model, 
    $\Delta Z_{\nu} = Z_{\nu}-\left<Z_{\nu}\right>$ (\emph{middle left}), 
    where brackets indicate full-survey averages. Correspondingly, the 
    final $\chi^2$ is defined through $\Delta I_{\nu} - \Delta Z_{\nu}$ 
    (\emph{bottom left}), and is by constrution only sensitive to 
    time-variable signals. In contrast, the basic data element in 
    \Cosmoglobe\ is the full sky signal, $I_{\nu}$ (\emph{top right}), 
    which is fitted with the full zodiacal light model, $Z_{\nu}$ 
    (\emph{middle right}), both modelled in time-domain. The $\chi^2$ 
    the minimizes minimize the total signal-minus-model residual, 
    $I_{\nu}-Z_{\nu}$ (\emph{bottom right}). The main advantage of the 
    DIRBE approach is insensitivity to stationary sky signals, in 
    particular thermal dust and CIB, while the main advantage of the 
    \Cosmoglobe\ approach is a much higher effective signal-to-noise 
    ratio, both to zodiacal light parameters and zero-levels.}

    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/mask_zodi_fitting.pdf}
    \caption{Masks applied when fitting zodiacal light parameters for 
    the $2.2\mathrm{\mu m}$, $25\mathrm{\mu m}$ and $240\mathrm{\mu m}$ 
    bands.}
    \label{fig:masks}
\end{figure}
The K98 model was obtained by fitting the model to a set of week-maps. 
The $\chi^2$ measure used by the DIRBE team is given by
\begin{equation}
    \chi^2_\mathrm{K98} = \Delta I_\nu - \Delta Z_\nu,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
    &\Delta I_\nu = I_\nu - \langle I_\nu \rangle,\\
    &\Delta Z_\nu = Z_\nu - \langle Z_\nu \rangle,
\end{align}
and $I_\nu$ and $Z_\nu$ are the full-mission frequency and ZL estimate 
maps, and $\Delta I\nu$ and $\Delta Z_\nu$ are the difference between 
the full-mission and a week frequency and ZL map, respectively. These 
maps are illustrated in the left column in Figure~\ref{fig:week_vs_full}. 
$\chi^2_\mathrm{K98}$ is by construction only sensitive to time-variable 
signal, effectively removing the need for a good sky model of the then 
less well-understood infrared sky. Using week maps instead of the full 
timestreams has the additional effect of reducing the overall data 
volume in the fits, which would seem beneficial considering the 
computing resources available during the early DIRBE analysis. A 
downside of this method is that the monopole induced by the smooth ZL is 
removed, resulting in a much weaker signal-to-noise ratio in the ZL 
parameter estimates and to the zero-levels. In contrast, we fit the data 
at each time step to the signal minus model residual
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chisq}
    \chi^2 = I_\nu - Z_\nu.
\end{equation}

To minimize the amount of unmodeled galactic emission that enters our 
ZL parameter estimates, we use strict channel-specific processing masks, 
masking out the brightest galactic regions. The 1.25, 25, and 240 $\mu$m 
masks, corresponding to stellar light, ZL, and thermal dust-dominated 
channels, are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:masks}.


\subsection{Sampling zodiacal light parameters}
The total number of free ZL model parameters in this analysis are N, 
compared to the M parameters fit in K98. We have included a non-zero
scattering contribution at 4.9 $\mu$m. This 


ZL parameters are sampled as part of the Gibbs sweep in Commander3 (see 
Equation something in Paper I). We use a function minimizer, to minimize 
a variant of Equation~\eqref{eq:chisq} using a downsampled version of the
TOD as described in Section~\ref{sect:optimization}. The minimizer employed
is Powell's method, which performs bi-directional searches along a parameter 
vector. Initially we attempted to use MCMC methods such as a 
Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampler, and a combined Gibbs and MH sampler but
due to the high-dimensional parameter space of 
The reason we are not using MCMC 
sampling is due to the difficulty of exploring the entire parameter space 
appropriately due to the many degeneracies between the model parameters. 
Following the Powell minimization, random noise is added to each parameter
to simulate a stochastic draw. 

We can improve our error estimates on the ZL parameters by including the 
Powell search history in our error estimation. For each bi-directional 
search, we output both the parameter values and the intermediate $\chi^2$
values which lets us find the 95\% confidence interval in the search. This
is used jointly with the uncertienties determined from the Gibbs chain.

% \section{Introduction}
% Zodiacal light (ZL, sometimes zodiacal emission or interplanetary dust emission) is the primary source of diffuse radiation observed in the infrared sky between 1-100 $\mu$m (\cite{leinert1998} and references therein). The light comes from scattering and re-emission of sunlight from interplanetary dust grains. ZL has been the most problematic source of foreground contamination in studies of the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) the infrared sky due, mainly due to its time-varying nature. Improving our understanding of the interplanetary medium and 
%building better ZL models is arguably the most critical step in making a large part of the infrared sky accessible to cosmological analysis. 

% The current state-of-the-art ZL model is the Kelsall et al. 1998 (K98), which was developed by the DIRBE team for the purpose of removing ZL from their data. It consists of a parametric three-dimensional model of the interplanetary dust distribution with several distinguishable components such as 
% These components were assumed to emit like modified blackbodies and could be evaluated through line-of-sight integrations to simulate the observed zodiacal light. 


% Ever since it was first understood in the 17th century \citep{cassini}, zodiacal light has been a driving force for the exploration of the interplanetary medium. The Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) instrument, onboard the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), found that the zodiacal light could be effectively characterized in the infrared \citep{mather:1994, hauser:1998}. The DIRBE team developed a geometric model that represented the interplanetary medium and its identifiable components.
% These components were assumed to emit like modified blackbodies and could be evaluated through line-of-sight integrations to simulate the observed zodiacal light. This model, detailed in \cite{K98}, (here-after K98), has demonstrated its effectiveness in describing zodiacal light in the infrared and sub-millimeter domains and has been the default modeling used in the cosmology community for the past twenty years. The Planck Collaboration \citep{PLANCK2013, PLANCK2015, PLANCK2018} recently utilized the DIRBE model in their analysis of the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) data. They adapted the model to be applicable at sub-terahertz frequencies by evaluating the K98 model with the HFI scanning strategy and fitting an overall amplitude to model components.

% The ZL is considered a local foreground in CMB studies with the emission originating from the near vicinity of the observer. This is a contrast to more common foregrounds such as the CMB and galactic thermal dust emission, which we assume to be stationary in the sky. Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds can be modeled with a single template describing the structure of the component at some reference frequency. The template can then be scaled to arbitrary frequencies given a description of the component's spectral energy density (SED). Simple models like this does not apply to the zodiacal light, which highly depends on the position and time of observation.
% It is impossible to describe and model the zodiacal light foreground through a single template, applicable to all experiments. Instead, the zodiacal light must be dynamically modeled on a per-experiment basis taking into account the position of the observer within the solar system and the scanning strategy. 

% The main highlight of this work is that we are able to produce a better zodiacal light model with much smaller residuals in the frequency maps using only the same zodiacal light-contaminated data used by the DIRBE team in their original analysis. We attribute most of this success to the Cosmoglobe effort of joint global Bayesian analysis of the time-ordered DIRBE data along with maps and point source catalogs from HFI, FIRAS, and WISE. This results in a much better constrained sky model than what was possible at the time of the original DIRBE analysis, making it easier to distinguish the zodiacal light from other signal sources. Additionally, when 
% fitting the zodiacal light model parameters, the DIRBE team used week maps differenced by the full survey sky map. While this removes all static signals from the sky, it also kills much of the effective signal-to-noise ratio for both zodiacal light parameters and the zero levels. In the Cosmoglobe approach, we fit all zodiacal light parameters directly to the timestreams, making it easier to resolve the degeneracies of the geometric interplanetary dust parameters. 

% This goes to show that even when only using archival data, it is possible to create more robust descriptions of the interplanetary medium and the observed zodiacal light. In coming Cosmoglobe data releases we will include more zodiacal light-contaminated time-ordered data from experiments such as AKARI and IRAS, which will help break many of the geometric parameter degeneracies in the interplanetary dust model due to the complimentary scanning strategies of the respective experiments.

% In this paper, we will detail the zodiacal light modeling approach used in the Commander framework during the production of Cosmoglobe DR2. Furthermore, the perhaps greatest result from this works comes from the fitting of the model parameters from a Bayesian perspective, utilizing all DIRBE bands jointly along with HFI, FIRAS and WISE data to produce the best zodiacal light model of the infrared sky. 
% In Sect. 2 we describe zodiacal light model in terms of the interplanetary dust models, source functions, and line-of-sight integrations. 
% Additionally, introduce and interpret the zodiacal light in the DIRBE time-ordered data. Finally we discuss the sampling techniques used to fit the many zodiacal light model parameters from a Bayesian perspective. In Sect. 3 we reanalyze the DIRBE data using the K98 model as derived by the DIRBE team, and see that we recover their results. 
% In Sect. 4 we explore extensions to the K98 model by lifting some of the constraints set on the model parameter by the DIRBE team, and including some of the more physical descriptions of the zodiacal components from \cite{RRM}. These extended models are referred to as model A and B, where model A is the relaxed K98 model, while model B is a more complex model with additional modifications.



% \subsection{Rowan-Robinson and May (RRM) model}
% In the RRM model, the components are described in terms of the radial distance from the component center $r_c$ and the the latitude above the symmetry-plane $\beta_0$. The transformation between the two angular and cartesian representations are given by $z_c = r_c \sin{\beta_0}$, 
% \begin{equation}
%     \beta_0 = \arctan\left(\frac{z_c}{r_c}\right).
% \end{equation}

% \subsubsection{The fan}
% The fan is the RRM equivalent of the diffuse cloud in the K98 model. The density of the fan is described in a separable form similar to the diffuse cloud
% \begin{equation}
%     n_{\mathrm{Fan}}\left(r_\mathrm{Fan}, \beta_0\right)=n_0 r_\mathrm{Fan}^{-\gamma} f\left(\beta_0\right),
% \end{equation}
% but the vertical distribution is rather given as 
% \begin{equation}
% f\left(\beta_0\right)=\left(\cos \beta_0\right)^Q \exp \left(-P \sin \left|\beta_0\right|^{\xi}\right),
% \end{equation}
% where
% \begin{equation}\ 
% \xi= \begin{cases}
%     2 - |z_{\mathrm{Fan}}/z_{\mathrm{Fan}, 0}| \mid & \text { for }|z_\mathrm{Fan}|<z_{\mathrm{Fan}, 0} \\     1 & \text { otherwise },
% \end{cases}
% \end{equation}
% Add more components if we use them.

% The approach we will use Gibbs sample each of the model parameters. This means that we propose a change to one model parameter, estimate the zodiacal emission over the full timestream of each ten DIRBE bands, compute a chi-squared and accept/reject. We perform N such proposals before we move on the the next parameter. Since the zodiacal emission is mostly very smooth on the sky, we can afford to downsample the TOD timestream before evaluating the zodiacal emission. For the diffuse cloud and the dust bands we downsample the TODS by X. For the circum-solar ring and the Earth-trailing feature, which are less smooth, and harder to constrain, we downsample the TODS by X. The downsampled TODS are subtracted by the \Cosmoglobe\ skymodel, and recomputed after after each parameter evaluation.
