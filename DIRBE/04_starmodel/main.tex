   \abstract{We present a model of starlight emission and extragalactic pointsources in the Diffuse Infrared Background Explorer (DIRBE) data between 1.25 and 25$\,\mu$m based on GAIA and WISE measurements. We include three classes of compact objects: Bright point sources with spectral energy densities (SEDs) measured by GAIA, most likely stars within our own galaxy, bright point sources without SED data, which are most likely extra-galactic sources, and a diffuse background of dim pointsource emission. We find that the number of stars with a statistically significant flux density detected at Galactic latitudes $|b|>20^{\circ}$ at more than than $5\,\sigma$ is 313\,061 stars, for an average of 0.4~stars per DIRBE beam area. Furthermore, based on this model we find that total star emission accounts for 98\,\% of the observed flux density at 1.25\,$\mu$m; 83\,\% at 4.9$\,\mu$m; and 3\,\% at 25\,$\mu$m. We also find a population of 66\,217 extragalactic pointsources, which are modelled using a generalized blackbody. Finally, we also include the contribution from the diffuse background of faint sources, which is fit as an independent component in the model. As shown in companion papers, this new model is sufficiently accurate to allow for precise characterization of both extragalactic background (cosmic infrared and optical background; CIB and COB) fluctuations and Galactic (free-free and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dust) emission in the four highest DIRBE frequencies.      }

\section{Introduction}
%\the\textwidth \the\columnwidth

Modelling the microwave sky in the COBE-Diffuse Infrared Background Explorer (DIRBE) data  \citep{DIRBE} from 1 to 100000 GHz requires a  understanding of all the various components that make it up. At the highest frequencies, the largest power contribution comes from stars in our galaxy, as can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:sed}, as well as resolved extragalactic point sources. The smallest wavelength/highest frequency bands 1-4 are dominated by star emissions, making accurate star modelling essential for using these data in combination with others in a comprehensive Bayesian model of the large-scale infrared sky. Additionally, pointsources are subdominant contributors in DIRBE bands 5 and 6, which if not handled correctly could heavily skew derived constraints on the zodiacal light and other components.

Many full-sky datasets exist which measure the emissions from pointsources in our galaxy and beyond. Staring with IRAS in 1983 \citep{iras}, there have been several ground and space missions to map the infrared sky and put constraints on star star formation and evolution, the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), including the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) \citep{iso}, Spitzer \citep{spitzer}, the 2-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) \citep{2mass}, and the current-generation James Webb Space Telescope \citep{jwst}. For the purposes of compatibility with the DIRBE data, however, the most useful external datasets are the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) \citep{wise}, and GAIA, which produced high precision star observations at optical wavelengths \citep{gaia, gaia2}.

In this paper, part of the larger Cosmoglobe DR2 results paper suite, we discuss the modelling of compact objects as part of our larger full sky astrophysical model. Section \ref{sec:models} discusses this modelling in a larger Bayesian context. Section \ref{sec:results} shows the astrophysical results of the work by presenting a unified star model and its associated errors. Section \ref{sec:consistency} then shows the consistency between our results and other work in this area. Finally, we conclude in Section \ref{sec:conclusions}, discussing the impacts of this work and offering some avenues for future research.

\section{Compact Object modelling in a Bayesian context}
\label{sec:models}

In this work, we break the compact objects into three categories as follows: 1 - Bright (> Mag 8 in the WISE 3.4 $\,\mu$m) objects with SEDs measured by Gaia (hereafter 'stars'), described in section \ref{sec:starmodel}, 2 - Bright objects without SED information (hereafter 'extragalactic sources'), described in section \ref{sec:extragalacticmodel}, and a diffuse background of dim objects (hereafter 'diffuse'), described in section \ref{sec:diffusemodel}.

\subsection{Stars}

\label{sec:starmodel}

For each star we extract estimates of the effective temperature, $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, the gravitational acceleration, $\log g$, and the metallicity, $[M/H]$, from the GAIA DR2 database \cite{gaiaCat}, and use those to identify a best-fit spectral energy density (SED) from the PHOENIX starlight database. 

The full Bayesian data mode is shown in \cite{CG02_01}, and includes the star component $s_{stars}(p, \lambda_j)$, the star emissions as a function of pixel $p$ and frequency $\lambda_j$ for a band $j$. Equation \ref{eq:datamodel} shows the data model for the star component that we describe in this paper


\begin{equation}
s_{stars}(p, \lambda_j) = \sum_i a_i B_i(p, \lambda_j) E_i(\lambda_j),
\label{eq:datamodel}
\end{equation}

where in the notation of \cite{CG02_01} 

\begin{equation}
f_{\mathrm{GAIA}} = B_i(p, \lambda_j) E_i(\lambda_j),
\end{equation}

which is the beam-convolved SED taken from the PHOENIX catalogue.

Here, we sum over each star $i$, where $a_i$ is a single overall amplitude parameter fit per star and $B_i(p, \lambda)$ is the instrument beam for a detector at frequency $\lambda$ in a pixel $p$ for a given star $i$. $E_i(\lambda)$ is the normalized emission for a given frequency $\lambda$. The emission $E_i$ is drawn directly from the GAIA data and the PHOENIX starlight database (see Sec. \ref{sec:catalogue}), and the beam $B$ is fixed for each detector, so we fit only the overall amplitude $a_i$ for each star in this model. This greatly reduces the degeneracies between the stars and other astrophysical components such as dust, and was found to work better than fitting a full SED per star. We include a star component in DIRBE bands 01-06, as at longer wavelengths the contribution from star emission was greatly subdominant to zodiacal light and dust, and including that data degraded the quality of the amplitude fits. 

To sample the star amplitudes $a_i$ we attempt to minimize the residual in each band for each source $i$

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:minimize}
X_ia_i - Y_i = 0.
\end{equation}

The solution is just the mapmaking equation, where

\begin{equation}
X_i = S^T N^{-1} S = \sum_{j,p}\frac{E_{ij}^2 B^2_{ij}(p)}{\sigma_j^2(p)} 
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
Y_i = S^TN^{-1}d = \sum_{j,p} \frac{E_{ij}B_{ij}(p) d_j(p)}{\sigma_j^2(p)}.
\end{equation}

Here, $\sigma_j^2(p)$ is the noise in pixel $p$ in band $j$, and $d_j(p)$ is the data map in band $j$ at pixel $p$. To reduce degeneracies, we fit the point sources on a data map with all other astrophysical components already removed, so $d_j(p)$ contains only noise and the point source $i$. The solution to \ref{eq:minimize} is simply $a_i = \frac{Y_i}{X_i}$, which gives a single overall amplitude for each star $i$. To sample the amplitudes, we also include a fluctuation term, such that our final sample for the amplitudes is given by

\begin{equation}
a_i = \frac{Y_i}{X_i} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{X_i}} N_i(0,1),
\end{equation}

where $N_i(0,1)$ is a sample drawn from a unit Gaussian with 0 mean.

\subsection{Extragalactic Pointsources}

\label{sec:extragalacticmodel}

After fitting the star catalogue, we are left with another background of pointsources, those with extragalactic origins. Sources that do not match against the GAIA catalogue or that do not have sufficient SED information to model, but which are still brighter than magnitude 5.06 in the WISE $3.4 \mu m$ band ($3000$ MJy in DIRBE 01) are fit with a more general blackbody of the form:

\begin{equation}
\frac{e^{\frac{\nu_0 h}{k_b \theta}} - 1}{e^{\frac{\nu h}{k_b \theta}} - 1} * (\frac{\nu}{\nu_0})^{\theta_2 + 1}
\end{equation}

Here, $\nu_0$ is a reference frequency, set to $239833.966$ GHz (1.25 $\mu m$). 



\subsection{Diffuse Star Emission}

\label{sec:diffusemodel}

Finally, after modelling the brightest sources using one of the two methods described above, we are left with a diffuse background of stars that are too dim to be individually resolved, but that can still couple to other parameters such as the band monopoles and so must be accounted for. We model this diffuse background using a single full-sky template, generated from the WISE W1 data. We take the full AllWISE pointsource catalog, and for each source with a included W1 magnitude that isn't already included in one of the previous pointsource models (ie. sources dimmer than Mag. 5) we create a high resolution healpix map \citep{healpix} at nside=2048. Adding each source in turn to this map, we then downgrade to nside=512, which gives the map shown in Fig. \ref{fig:diffuseStars}. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/diffuseTemplate/diffuse_stars.pdf}
  \caption{The template of diffuse star emission evaluated in the DIRBE 01 band.}
  \label{fig:diffuse}
\end{figure}

This template is then included in the full sky model, and fit jointly in bands 01-04, with an SED given by the mean of all SEDs of stars modelled in section \ref{sec:starmodel}. This SED is fit with a single amplitude parameter, which compensates for the overall difference in bandpass between W1 and the DIRBE bands. The mean of this SED averaged over all the samples in the full chain is shown as the red line in Fig. \ref{fig:starSEDs}.

\subsection{Maps}

In Figure \ref{fig:starsT} we show the mean star component maps for the full pipeline run in all six DIRBE bands where stars are subtracted. Here, the maps show the sum of star component and the extragalactic source component, which fully accounts for the pointsource emission in the galactic plane.

\subsection{Spectral Energy Densities}

Figure \ref{fig:starSEDs} shows the SED models for all 717454 star sources in our catalogue, as well as the full sky mean emission attributable to stars.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Stars are a critical component of the infrared sky, which must be correctly modelled in order to avoid contaminating other components. 

Impact of star modelling

\subsection{Future Work}

Including the WISE data directly in the full run would be an important next step, and could potentially give enough extra information to constrain the star SEDs directly instead of pre-computing them.
