   \abstract{We present a model of starlight emission and extragalactic pointsources in the Diffuse Infrared Background Explorer (DIRBE) data between 1.25 and 25$\,\mu$m based on GAIA and WISE measurements. We include three classes of compact objects: Bright point sources with spectral energy densities (SEDs) measured by GAIA, most likely stars within our own galaxy, bright point sources without SED data, which are most likely extra-galactic sources, and a diffuse background of dim pointsource emission. We find that the number of stars with a statistically significant flux density detected at Galactic latitudes $|b|>20^{\circ}$ at more than than $5\,\sigma$ is 313\,061 stars, for an average of 0.4~stars per DIRBE beam area. Furthermore, based on this model we find that total star emission accounts for 98\,\% of the observed flux density at 1.25\,$\mu$m; 83\,\% at 4.9$\,\mu$m; and 3\,\% at 25\,$\mu$m. We also find a population of 66\,217 extragalactic pointsources, which are modelled using a generalized blackbody. Finally, we also include the contribution from the diffuse background of faint sources, which is fit as an independent component in the model. As shown in companion papers, this new model is sufficiently accurate to allow for precise characterization of both extragalactic background (cosmic infrared and optical background; CIB and COB) fluctuations and Galactic (free-free and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dust) emission in the four highest DIRBE frequencies.      }

\section{Introduction}
%\the\textwidth \the\columnwidth

Modelling the microwave sky in the COBE-Diffuse Infrared Background Explorer (DIRBE) data  \citep{DIRBE} from 1 to 100000 GHz requires a  understanding of all the various components that make it up. At the highest frequencies, the largest power contribution comes from stars in our galaxy, as can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:sed}, as well as resolved extragalactic point sources. The smallest wavelength/highest frequency bands 1-4 are dominated by star emissions, making accurate star modelling essential for using these data in combination with others in a comprehensive Bayesian model of the large-scale infrared sky. Additionally, pointsources are subdominant contributors in DIRBE bands 5 and 6, which if not handled correctly could heavily skew derived constraints on the zodiacal light and other components.

Many full-sky datasets exist which measure the emissions from pointsources in our galaxy and beyond. Staring with IRAS in 1983 \citep{iras}, there have been several ground and space missions to map the infrared sky and put constraints on star star formation and evolution, the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), including the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) \citep{iso}, Spitzer \citep{spitzer}, the 2-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) \citep{2mass}, and the current-generation James Webb Space Telescope \citep{jwst}. For the purposes of compatibility with the DIRBE data, however, the most useful external datasets are the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) \citep{wise}, and GAIA, which produced high precision star observations at optical wavelengths \citep{gaia, gaia2}.

In this paper, part of the larger Cosmoglobe DR2 results paper suite, we discuss the modelling of compact objects as part of our larger full sky astrophysical model. Section \ref{sec:models} discusses this modelling in a larger Bayesian context. Section \ref{sec:consistency} shows the consistency between our results and other work in this area. Section \ref{sec:data} discusses the data selection and cleaning used in our analysis, and then Section \ref{sec:results} shows the astrophysical results of the work by presenting a unified star model and its associated errors. Finally, we conclude in Section \ref{sec:conclusions}, discussing the impacts of this work and offering some avenues for future research.

\section{Compact Object modelling in a Bayesian context}
\label{sec:models}

For each star brighter than magnitude 8 in the WISE 3.4$\,\mu$m band \citep{wiseCat}, we extract estimates of the effective temperature, $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, the gravitational acceleration, $\log g$, and the metallicity, $[M/H]$, from the GAIA DR2 database \cite{gaiaCat}, and use those to identify a best-fit spectral energy density (SED) from the PHOENIX starlight database. The NUMBER sources which pass our WISE magnitude cut but which either do not match against the GAIA catalogue or do not have sufficient data in GAIA to estimate an SED are assumed to be extra-galactic sources. Finally, the remaining sources from the WISE point-source catalogue that are not included in either of these other populations are used to construct a full sky diffuse point-source template, which is fit as a component in the full commander run. 

\subsection{Stars}

The full Bayesian data model is shown in \cite{CG02_01}, and includes the star component $s_{stars}(p, \lambda_j)$, the star emissions as a function of pixel $p$ and frequency $\lambda_j$ for a band $j$. Equation \ref{eq:datamodel} shows the data model for the star component that we describe in this paper

\begin{equation}
s_{stars}(p, \lambda_j) = \sum_i a_i B_i(p, \lambda_j) E_i(\lambda_j),
\label{eq:datamodel}
\end{equation}

where in the notation of \cite{CG02_01} 

\begin{equation}
f_{\mathrm{GAIA}} = B_i(p, \lambda_j) E_i(\lambda_j),
\label{eq:datamodel}
\end{equation}

which is the beam-convolved SED taken from the PHOENIX catalogue.

Here, we sum over each star $i$, where $a_i$ is a single overall amplitude parameter fit per star and $B_i(p, \lambda)$ is the instrument beam for a detector at frequency $\lambda$ in a pixel $p$ for a given star $i$. $E_i(\lambda)$ is the normalized emission for a given frequency $\lambda$. The emission $E_i$ is drawn directly from the GAIA data and the PHOENIX starlight database (see Sec. \ref{sec:catalogue}), and the beam $B$ is fixed for each detector, so we fit only the overall amplitude $a_i$ for each star in this model. This greatly reduces the degeneracies between the stars and other astrophysical components such as dust, and was found to work better than fitting a full SED per star. We include a star component in DIRBE bands 01-06, as at longer wavelengths the contribution from star emission was greatly subdominant to zodiacal light and dust, and including that data degraded the quality of the amplitude fits. 

To sample the star amplitudes $a_i$ we attempt to minimize the residual in each band for each source $i$

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:minimize}
X_ia_i - Y_i = 0.
\end{equation}

The solution is just the mapmaking equation, where

\begin{equation}
X_i = S^T N^{-1} S = \sum_{j,p}\frac{E_{ij}^2 B^2_{ij}(p)}{\sigma_j^2(p)} 
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
Y_i = S^TN^{-1}d = \sum_{j,p} \frac{E_{ij}B_{ij}(p) d_j(p)}{\sigma_j^2(p)}.
\end{equation}

Here, $\sigma_j^2(p)$ is the noise in pixel $p$ in band $j$, and $d_j(p)$ is the data map in band $j$ at pixel $p$. To reduce degeneracies, we fit the point sources on a data map with all other astrophysical components already removed, so $d_j(p)$ contains only noise and the point source $i$. The solution to \ref{eq:minimize} is simply $a_i = \frac{Y_i}{X_i}$, which gives a single overall amplitude for each star $i$. To sample the amplitudes, we also include a fluctuation term, such that our final sample for the amplitudes is given by

\begin{equation}
a_i = \frac{Y_i}{X_i} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{X_i}} N_i(0,1),
\end{equation}

where $N_i(0,1)$ is a sample drawn from a unit Gaussian with 0 mean.

\subsection{Extragalactic Pointsources}

After fitting the star catalogue, we are left with another background of pointsources, those with extragalactic origins. Sources that do not match against the GAIA catalogue or that do not have sufficient SED information to model, but which are still brighter than magnitude 5.06 in the WISE $3.4 \mu m$ band ($3000$ MJy in DIRBE 01) are fit with a more general blackbody of the form:

\begin{equation}
\frac{e^{\frac{\nu_0 h}{k_b \theta}} - 1}{e^{\frac{\nu h}{k_b \theta}} - 1} * (\frac{\nu}{\nu_0})^{\theta_2 + 1}
\end{equation}

Here, $\nu_0$ is a reference frequency, set to $239833.966$ GHz (1.25 $\mu m$). 

\subsection{Diffuse Star Background}

The diffuse star background is made up of the remainder of the 747 634 026 objects in the AllWISE catalogue \citep{wiseCat}. These are

SEDs for extragalactic sources


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Stars are a critical component of the infrared sky, which must be correctly modelled in order to avoid contaminating other components. 

Impact of star modelling

\subsection{Future Work}

Including the WISE data directly in the full run would be an important next step, and could potentially give enough extra information to constrain the star SEDs directly instead of pre-computing them.
