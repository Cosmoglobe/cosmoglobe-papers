\abstract{
  We present the first statistically consistent model of full-sky polarized synchrotron emission derived from the combination of all \WMAP\ and \Planck\ LFI frequency maps. The basis of this analysis are the end-to-end reprocessed \cosmoglobe\ Data Release 1 sky maps presented in a companion paper, which have significantly lower instrumental systematics than the legacy products from each experiment. We find that the resulting polarized synchrotron amplitude map has an average noise rms of $2.4\muK$ at 22\,GHz and a smoothing scale of $2^{\circ}$ FWHM, which is 30\,\% lower than the recently released \BP\ model that included only LFI+\WMAP\ \Ka--\V\ data, and it is 45\,\% lower than the raw \WMAP\ \K-band. The mean $EE/BB$ power spectrum ratio is $0.27\pm0.02$, which agrees well with previous estimates from both \Planck\ and QUIJOTE. Assuming a power law model for the synchrotron spectral energy density, we find a full-sky inverse noise-variance weighted mean of $\beta_{\mathrm{s}}=-3.06\pm0.08$ between \WMAP\ \K-band and LFI 30\,GHz, in good agreement with previous estimates. At high Galactic latitudes, however, we find $\beta_{\mathrm{s}}=-3.31\pm0.08$, which is slightly steeper than most previous foregrounds-oriented estimates, but in good agreement with the \Planck\ 2018 LFI CMB likelihood result of $\beta_{\mathrm{s}}=-3.27\pm0.04$. For comparison, the corresponding full-sky and high-latitude estimates derived from the offical \WMAP\ and LFI products are $\beta_{\mathrm{s}}=-3.44\pm0.08$ and $\beta_{\mathrm{s}}=-3.71\pm0.08$, respectively. These values are obviously compromised by large-scale instrumental systematics in both \WMAP\ and LFI. In summary, the novel \cosmoglobe\ DR1 synchrotron model is both more sensitive and systematically cleaner than similar previous models, and it has a more complete error description that is defined by a set of Monte Carlo posterior samples. We believe that these products are preferable for all synchrotron-related scientific applications, including simulation, forecasting and component separation.

Just because I am really tired and confused, let's write some extra stuff down here. What are we doing in this paper?

First, we show that the synchrotron map is the most sensitive map to date. If one wishes to use a map of synchrotron, they shouldn't use \K-band or 30\,GHz alone, but the combination of the \cosmoglobe\ DR1 maps that we present here. Compared to the frequency maps and the \bp\ release, the noise level is much better. In addition, the results in power spectrum space are coherent, and power spectra of the half-mission splits give E/B ratios consistent with previous analyses.

Second, with these improved maps, we can look at the spatial variation of the polarized synchrotron spectral index, using a model-independent TT plot approach. Here, we find (1) better agreement between the \cosmoglobe\ \K\ and 30\,GHz bands than in \WMAPnine\ and \Planck\ PR4, and (2) more consistent spectral indices between \K\ and \Ka\ and \K\ and 30\,GHz.

Finally, we have run an independent pixel-based analysis including all data, using \commanderone,  and find high signal-to-noise spectral index maps. With this, we're able to look at residuals and figure out what is weird that is going on, including this \Ka-band haze that only exists in Stokes $Q$, and also find there is a strong correlation with the Fermi bubbles.

In short, these maps are good, and you guys should use them.


\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Understanding the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a primary focus of observational cosmology in the coming decades. Following the success of the satellite-based COBE, \WMAP, and \Planck\ experiments, as well as sub-orbital experiments including, e.g., BICEP, ACT, SPT, Polarbear, and many others, the future LiteBIRD satellite and ground-based Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 experiments will create the most sensitive maps of the polarized sky yet, providing the most stringent constraints on primordial gravitational waves.

In the past decade, uncertainty on cosmological constraints has been limited not only by instrumental sensitivity, but by incomplete knowledge of the sky itself. These analysis difficulties have been mitigated by analyzing maps from different experiments, e.g., \citet{pb2015}, or designing of experiments with broad frequency coverage, such as \WMAP\ \citep{bennett2012} and \Planck\ \citep{planck2016-l01}. A major impediment to joint analyses is the difficulty of combining data with different survey strategies and incompletely characterized systematics. In order to maximize scientific throughput, one must either design an experiment that can characterize every relevant observable on its own, or jointly analyze different datasets in the same joint framework.

The \bp\ project achieved this joint analysis by combining external data, i.e., the Haslam 408\,MHz map \citep{haslam1982}, \WMAP\ \Ka--\V\ bands, \Planck\ 353\,GHz in polarization, and \Planck\ 857\,GHz in intensity, while analyzing the \Planck\ 30, 44, and 70 GHz TOD \citep{bp01}.
The \Planck\ LFI experiment showed that raw detector sensitivity was not enough to obtain high-fidelity sky maps; \citet{planck2016-l02} found that the detector gain solution depended on the assumed polarization and intensity of the sky. To break this circular dependency, the \bp\ framework solved for the intrinsic sky signal and instrumental parameters iteratively, providing an accurate model of the entire system with full error propagation. By leveraging external data, \bp\ was able to create \Planck\ LFI maps of cosmological quality, while generating a robust model of the foreground sky.

In \cosmoglobe\ DR1 \citep{watts2023_dr1}, this end-to-end framework was extended, performing a joint analysis of the same data as \bp\ while adding the full \WMAP\ time-ordered data. This analysis not only improved the quality of the \WMAP\ maps themselves, but provided the most robust full-sky model of low frequency polarized emission available to date.

In order to make use of the synchrotron model, we require robust estimates of the spectral behavior. Fundamental behaviors, such as the spectral index as a function of frequency, spatial decorrelation, and even the functional form of the SED, are yet to be fully characterized observationally. Modern attempts have been stymied by the lack of high signal-to-noise data; \citet{deBelsunce:2022}, for example, find spectral indices ranging from $-5$ to $-1$, well outside of the theoretical limits of (?), given in, e.g., (?). This discrepancy is largely due to inadequate data coverage, requiring higher signal-to-noise datasets that have not yet been generated. Therefore, any conclusions about the distribution of the polarized synchrotron spectral index must be verified through multiple independent analysis methods and data choices.


While the combination of as many datasets as possible would help to constrain polarized synchrotron's large-scale properties, long-standing discrepancies complicates this. As shown in, e.g., \citet{planck2014-a12} and \citet{weiland:2018}, there are discrepancies in the polarization measurements of \WMAP\ and \Planck, partially due to unconverged gain solutions \citep{planck2016-l02} and poorly measured mapmaking modes \citep{bennett2012}. \citet{bp01} resolved the unconverged gain solution creating low-systematics LFI maps for the first time, while \citet{bp17} demonstrated that the poorly measured modes in \WMAP\ could be removed through joint processing, while identifying a similar systematic effect that could mimic the previously-reported effect.  While \citet{watts2023_dr1} has demonstrated that the polarized maps from these two experiments are now consistent at the white noise level, the new maps must be validated first. As noted in, e.g., \citet{weiland:2022}, simply using a different LFI pipeline can result in non-physical sky components. 


In this work, we will use the \WMAP\ and LFI maps generated in the \cosmoglobe\ DR1 analysis. We perform three separate analyses; a map and power spectrum-based analysis of the synchrotron amplitude, linear correlation within regions (T-T plots), and per-pixel Gibbs sampling.

For the power spectra, compare with, e.g., Figure 33 of \citet{planck2016-l04}. We use the same bins as in Table C.1 of \citet{planck2016-l11A}




\section{Data products}
\label{sec:data}

In this paper, we investigate the spatial variation of the polarized synchrotron spectral index, with an emphasis on the comparison between  legacy maps against the \cosmoglobe\ results. The data products used are the \WMAP\ and \Planck\ LFI maps, with most of the statistical weight coming from 23--33\,GHz. These frequencies are low enough that we can treat them as synchrotron tracers and hence ignore thermal dust and CMB, but not so low as we need to take into account effects like Faraday rotation \citep{fuskeland:2019}. The legacy data products and the data products from the \cosmoglobe\ \WMAP\ reanalysis \citep{watts2023_dr1}, are described in the two following sections.


\subsection{\WMAP\ and \Planck\ legacy products}
\label{sec:wmap_data}

The \textit{Wilkinson Microwave Anistropy Probe} \citep[\WMAP]{bennett2012} was a NASA-funded satellite mission that observed from August 2001 to August 2010, designed to characterize the microwave sky well enough to measure the primary CMB anisotropies across the full sky down to a resolution of 13\arcm. Using a differential scanning strategy inspired by \COBE/DMR,
\WMAP\ produced maps of the sky at 23 (\K), 33 (\Ka), 41 (\Q), 61 (\V), and 94\,GHz (\W) in both polarization and intensity \citep{bennett2012}, with angular resolutions of 53\arcm\ at 23\,GHz to 13\arcm\ at 94\,\GHz. 
The maps are available on the LAMBDA website.\footnote{\url{https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/wmap/dr5/m_products.html}} 

The \Planck\ Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) produced  30, 44, and 70 GHz maps in both intensity and polarization, while the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) produced 100, 143, 217, 353\,GHz maps in polarization and intensity, and 545 and 857\,GHz maps in intensity alone. The LFI data in particular are similar to the \WMAP\ data, with higher angular resolutions of 30\arcm, 20\arcm, and 13\arcm\ for 30, 44, and 70 GHz, and with higher sensitivity. Although the detector design was similar, LFI observed with a single horn, and observed in rings closely aligned with the ecliptic longitude. The legacy datasets, PR3 \citep{planck2016-l01} and PR4 \citep{planck2020-LVII}, are both publicly available on the \Planck\ Legacy Archive (PLA).\footnote{\url{https://pla.esac.esa.int/}}

\subsection{\Cosmoglobe\ products}
\label{sec:cosmoglobe_data}

The goal of \Cosmoglobe\ is to perform joint end-to-end analyses on several data sets jointly, preferably beginning from raw time-ordered data (TOD). Doing this can help to break the degeneracies of the different data sets, and in general reduced the amplitude of systematic effects. The analysis in \citet{bp01} and \citet{watts2023_dr1} was performed on raw TOD to cosmological parameters using the Bayesian Gibbs sampler, \commanderthree. The data products produced in these analysis account for the complex interactions between the instrument, the microwave sky, and its consistutent components self-consistently. The full products from this analysis and individual maps are available on the \cosmoglobe\ website.\footnote{\href{https://www.cosmoglobe.uio.no/products/cosmoglobe-dr1.html}{\texttt{https://www.cosmoglobe.uio.no/products/\newline cosmoglobe-dr1.html}}}

% Annoying error when there is hyphen in url...

The analysis in this paper makes use of \cosmoglobe\ end products produced by the reanalysis of the \WMAP\ and \Planck\ LFI TODs \citep{watts2023_dr1}. This analysis produced improved \WMAP\ and \Planck\ LFI maps, which we will use in an analysis to compare to the legacy data. In particular, we are interested in exactly the same set of maps as in the previous section in order to be able to do a comparision study. The pixelization and angular scale are the same as for the legacy products ($N_\textrm{side}=64$, $1^\circ$ FWHM). The \cosmoglobe\ end products consists of a series of 500 samples from the Gibbs chain, instead of just one mean sample as has been the normal case for previous data releases.


\section{Polarized synchrotron amplitude}



\textit{Summary: an estimate of the synchrotron amplitude is necessary in order to perform template subtraction. The most robust estimate of any quantity comes from the combination of datasets that are generated from a statistical model that is consistent. For full-sky measurements, this would naively consist of combining high signal-to-noise polarized synchrotron measurements, like WMAP K-band, Ka-band, and Planck 30 GHz. Unfortunately, these datasets have been inconsistent in the official analyses. In my recent reanalysis, the maps are now consistent with each other at a level subdominant to known systematic effects, so we are able to optimally combine these data. Here are the maps that come from this and their noise properties, and also how much higher the sensitivity is compared to these previous results.

\cosmoglobe\ DR1 produced a sky model and instrumental parameters for each Gibbs sample, allowing for complete characterization of the dependence of low-level instrumental parameters on the sky model. The sky model includes all relevant components in \WMAP\ and LFI's frequency range, specifically the CMB, synchrotron, thermal dust, free-free emission, anomalous microwave emission, and radio point sources, the first three of which are known to be polarized. 

When using external data for polarized foreground cleaning, the choices for high signal-to-noise full sky constraints are either \WMAP\ \K-band, \Planck\ LFI 30\,GHz, or models derived from combinations of these data, as in, e.g., \cosmoglobe. From the perspective of pure statistical uncertainty, a combination of multiple independent datasets would yield component maps that are more sensitive than each individual component. However, unmodeled systematic uncertainties in the underlying datasets, left untreated, can induce map effects that can leak into astrophysics and cosmological constraints.
As shown in \citet{watts2023_dr1}, a single sky model that all datasets are calibrated against improves the low-level instrumental processing, and allowing for degeneracies, such as poorly-measured modes in \WMAP\ and differential gain uncertainty in LFI, to be broken. Within the \cosmoglobe\ DR1 framework, the polarization maps from \WMAP\ and \Planck\ LFI are consistent with each other at the $10\,\mathrm{\mu K}$ level, consistent with the instrumental white noise of the datasets.

The \cosmoglobe\ DR1 frequency maps are free from previously reported systematics, and are consistent between different frequencies and instruments. Therefore, a coherent model of polarized synchrotron emission can be made by combining these two different datasets.
The polarized spectral amplitude determined from \cosmoglobe\ fully utilizes the \Planck\ and \WMAP\ joint reprocessed data, as shown in as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:synch_polint}. 
We plot the total polarized amplitude $P=\sqrt{Q^2+U^2}$ for ease of comparison, although it creates a visible noise bias in the low signal-to-noise regions. Much of the constraining power in the polarized synchrotron amplitude comes from 

While the \cosmoglobe\ pipeline produces samples of polarized synchrotron emission, the spatial variation of the spectral index is poorly determined within the Gibbs chain. To mitigate the poor MCMC convergence of the spectral indices, the \cosmoglobe\ DR1 sampled the spectral index from a prior distribution, $\beta_s\sim\mathcal N(-3.15, 0.05^2)$. Improvements within the \commanderthree\ framework will require more high signal-to-noise data and algorithmic improvements within the codebase.



The \WMAP\ \K-band data and LFI 30\,GHz data, as the highest signal-to-noise full-sky polarized maps of Galactic synchrotron emission, are the main contributors to our knowledge of the polarized amplitude. The slightly higher angular resoolution 30\,GHz map has lower sensitivity than the \K-band data, but by combining the multi-resolution maps we are able to produce a clean map of the synchrotron emission evaluated at 30\,GHz with a FWHM of $1^\circ$.

%Each of these maps were produced with slightly different pipelines and datasets. The top row shows \Planck\ PR4 and \WMAPnine, and consists of entirely different datasets.\footnote{\textbf{Perhaps several samples of \WMAP-only would be useful to compare apples-to-apples, since these are all \commanderthree\ products.}} 

%The synchrotron solution is driven by the lowest frequency map, 30\,GHz and \K-band respectively, so any difference in the amplitude maps are due to differences in a combination of data processing, instrumental properties, and the microwave sky at 23\,GHz and 30\,GHz.

		\label{fig:rms_ratios}
\end{figure}


The synchrotron amplitude maps from end-to-end processing, \bp\ and \cosmoglobe, contain slightly different datasets, but sample the instrumental properties and sky properties jointly. Of these maps, \bp\ has lower resolution and higher noise, in large part because \cosmoglobe\ is able to use the reprocessed \WMAP\ \K-band map.
The \cosmoglobe\ synchrotron map has a mean posterior rms of $2.4\,\mathrm{\mu K}$, a marked improvement over the \bp\ map, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rms_ratios}. The rms map itself contains high signal-to-noise regions corresponding to the \WMAP\ circles about the ecliptic poles as well as the \Planck\ rings and multiple ecliptic polar crossings. The main clear astrophysical variation comes in the forms of a thin region about the Galactic plane and several low-latitude point sources. Much of the improvement can be seen more clearly when taking the ratio of the posterior rms's, as in the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:rms_ratios}. As expected, the regions with the lowest ratios correspond to the deep \WMAP\ observations and the Galactic plane, which benefit from the high signal-to-noise of the \K-band data. Regions with nearly identical rms include regions with the highest \Planck\ depth, i.e., the ecliptic poles, and regions less deeply observed by \WMAP, corresponding to planet crossings and artifacts from the processing mask. Notably, stripes corresponding the \Planck\ scan strategy also show improvement respect to \bp. This is due to the interaction between the sky model and LFI's instrumental parameters -- with the high signal-to-noise \K-band data, the sky model becomes more stable, and LFI's relative gain solution becomes better determined.





\subsection{Quantifying uncertainty}

(Consider this Duncan's notes, because there are some details that are a bit fuzzy.)

The \WMAP\ and \Planck\ rms maps are evaluated at pixelizations $N_\mathrm{side}=512$. If we simply downgrade maps, then the original noise per pixel scales as the area of the pixel, or $N_\mathrm{side,old}/N_\mathrm{side,new}$. For example, \K-band has an average rms of $91\,\mathrm{\mu K}$ at $N_\mathrm{side}=512$, while the same map at $N_\mathrm{side}=16$ has a white noise level of $\sim3\,\mathrm{\mu K}$, 32 times smaller.

When we smooth a map, we are doing something quite similar to downgrading, except now we are correlating pixels as well, so the noise amplitude will decrease proportional to the area that the Gaussian is averaging over. The correlations make this a bit trickier to get effective rms maps that are truly diagonal, but we'll stick with it for now.

The systematics are a bit different, since they don't actually average down with noise level, so for example, if you downgraded to $N_\mathrm{side}=8$, the poorly measured modes and the gain imbalance modes would not decrease. These are also a bit hard to see, so we smooth the maps an additional $2^\circ$.


For simple template fitting, with
\[
	d_\nu = A\left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_0}\right)^\beta+n_\nu=AT_\nu+n_\nu,
\]
we have the simple result
\[
	\hat A=\frac{\sum_\nu T_\nu d_\nu/\sigma_\nu^2}{\sum_\nu T_\nu^2/\sigma_\nu^2},\qquad
	\mathrm{var}(\hat A)=\frac1{\sum_\nu T_\nu^2/\sigma_\nu^2},
\]
so we would expect maps of the standard deviation of the synchrotron amplitude to look like inverse-weighted combinations of the data. This does seem to be the case, except we notice that the synchrotron map is evaluated at $N_\mathrm{side}=1024$ with a resolution of $40\arcm$, so the noise should actually be higher. Why isn't it?

I think partly because a prior is imposed
\[
	\hat D_s(\ell)=200\,\e^{-\ell(\ell+1)\sigma^2(30\arcm)}\mathrm{\mu K^2},
\]
which basically kills off everything smaller than $30\arcm$, approximately $N_\mathrm{side}=128$. Perhaps this is the resolution we should limit ourselves to, since these are the only scales that really contribute?

I think that is fair, since it's also roughly where the white noise starts to dominate, $\ell=100$.

As stated in \citet{bp14}, we use scale-dependent priors in component separation so that the prior will play a negligible role in signal-dominated regions, but play a stronger role in noise-dominated regions.


\subsection{Power spectra}

We needed to run a special \commanderthree\ chain, splitting the TODs into half mission, with all odd-numbered scans being processed in chain ``HM1'', and all even-numbered scans in ``HM2'', and produced 200 samples each. We provide these data at \url{cosmoglobe.uio.no}.

We perform cross-spectra to avoid an additive noise bias.

We use \texttt{NaMaster} using the original chain. To quantify the uncertainty, we take the cross spectrum for each pair of Gibbs samples from the adjacent chain, and report the 68\,\% confidence intervals on this posterior. We find good agreement with the EE/BB ratio reported in \Planck\ 2018 using their half-mission results. For the \Planck\ data, we use standard deviation of the single-$\ell$ spectrum values within each bin, while we add the systematic quadrature from the \cosmoglobe\ chain in quadrature. Compare with, e.g., \citet{planck2014-a12}'s Figure 44.

\subsection{Comparison with independent datasets}

First, the residual maps at \K, 30\,GHz. Then compare the evaluated sky model with \WMAPnine's \K-band map, PR3, and PR4.


\section{Polarized synchrotron spectral indices}

As pointed out in \citet{wehus:2013}, elliptical beams can induce a polarization angle-dependent spectral index for point sources, which can often be identified by performing analysis as a function of polarization angle. As both \WMAP\ and \Planck\ have asymmetric beam responses, this effect exists in the data, so spectral index estimation will be contaminated by this. Performing the TT analysis as a function of polarizatoin angle, as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:tt_plot}, shows the magntiude of this effect in the \cosmoglobe, \WMAPnine, and PR4 data.

\subsection{TT-plot method}
\label{sec:tt_plot}

        \caption{The sky is split into the same 24 regions as in \citet{fuskeland2014}. The most prominent point sources are masked out and shown as the grey circular areas.
        }
        \label{fig:regions}
\end{figure}


Following \citet{fuskeland2014} and \citet{fuskeland:2019}, we apply linear regression via the T-T (``temperature-temperature'') method, in which spectral indices can be estimated over extended regions with approxiately constant spectral indices. In this approach, our data model for two frequencies is
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol m_\nu = \boldsymbol m_{\nu_0}\left(\frac\nu{\nu_0}\right)^\beta+o_\nu+\boldsymbol n_\nu ,
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol m_\nu$ is a spatially varying amplitude map, $\nu_0$ is the reference frequency, $\beta$ the power law between the two frequencies, $o_\nu$ the spatially constant offset per band, and $\boldsymbol n_\nu$ the noise.  In the case of noiseleless data with no offset, the spectral index may be estimated using a simple ratio,
\begin{equation}
	\frac{m_{\nu_1,p}}{m_{\nu_2,p}}
	=\left(\frac{\nu_1}{\nu_2}\right)^{\beta_{s,p}}
	\Rightarrow
	\beta_{s,p}=\frac{\ln(m_{\nu_1,p}/m_{\nu_2,p})}{\ln(\nu_1/\nu_2)}.
\end{equation}
The standard T-T plot method computes performs a linear regression $\boldsymbol m_{\nu_1}=a\boldsymbol m_{\nu_2}+b$, and associates $\beta_s$ with $\ln a/\ln(\nu_1/\nu_2)$. More care must be taken when the noise amplitudes in both maps are comparable, so we adopt the effective variance method of \citet{orear1982} as implemented by \citet{fuskeland2014}.

For the T-T plot  analysis, we focus exclusively on bands between 23 and 33\,GHz. As in \citet{fuskeland2014}, we use the \WMAP\ \K\ and \Ka\ band Stokes $Q$ and $U$ parameter maps at $23$\,GHz and $33$\,GHz. The respective effective frequencies used are $22.45$\,GHz and $32.64$\,GHz. The maps originally at a \healpix\ pixelization of $N_\textrm{side}=512$ are downgraded to $N_\textrm{side}=64$ and smoothed to a common resolution of $1^\circ$ FWHM.
The \Planck\ data products used are the $30$\,GHz Stokes $Q$ and $U$ maps, with an effective frequency of $28.4$\,GHz.  The \cosmoglobe\ (PR4) products are natively at $N_\textrm{side}=512$ (1024), but as for the \WMAP\ products, the maps are downgraded to $N_\textrm{side}=64$ and smoothed to $1^\circ$ FWHM.

        \label{fig:cos20_beta_map}
\end{figure}

The uncertainty is calculated as the minimum of the uncertainties in each rotation angle, and region. As in the Fuskeland 2021 paper, an systematic uncertainty that takes into account the variation of $\beta$ over rotation angle; $[ \max(\beta_\alpha) - \min(\beta_\alpha) ] /2$ is added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty.
For the \Cosmoglobe\ analyses the standard deviation of the spectral indices for all samples is also added in quadrature to represent an additional systematic uncertainty.

Much better propagation of uncertainties with a whole suite of maps.
