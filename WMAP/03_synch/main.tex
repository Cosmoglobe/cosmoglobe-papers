  We present the first statistically consistent model of full-sky polarized synchrotron emission derived from the combination of all \WMAP\ and \Planck\ LFI frequency maps. The basis of this analysis are the end-to-end reprocessed \cosmoglobe\ Data Release 1 sky maps presented in a companion paper, which have significantly lower instrumental systematics than the legacy products from each experiment. We find that the resulting polarized synchrotron amplitude map has an average noise rms of $2.4\muK$ at 22\,GHz and a smoothing scale of $2^{\circ}$ FWHM, which is 30\,\% lower than the recently released \BP\ model that included only LFI+\WMAP\ \Ka--\V\ data, and it is 45\,\% lower than the raw \WMAP\ \K-band. The mean $EE/BB$ power spectrum ratio is $0.27\pm0.02$, which agrees well with previous estimates from both \Planck\ and QUIJOTE. Assuming a power law model for the synchrotron spectral energy density, we find a full-sky inverse noise-variance weighted mean of $\beta_{\mathrm{s}}=-3.06\pm0.08$ between \WMAP\ \K-band and LFI 30\,GHz, in good agreement with previous estimates. At high Galactic latitudes, however, we find $\beta_{\mathrm{s}}=-3.31\pm0.08$, which is slightly steeper than most previous foregrounds-oriented estimates, but in good agreement with the \Planck\ 2018 LFI CMB likelihood result of $\beta_{\mathrm{s}}=-3.27\pm0.04$. For comparison, the corresponding full-sky and high-latitude estimates derived from the offical \WMAP\ and LFI products are $\beta_{\mathrm{s}}=-3.44\pm0.08$ and $\beta_{\mathrm{s}}=-3.71\pm0.08$, respectively. These values are obviously compromised by large-scale instrumental systematics in both \WMAP\ and LFI. In summary, the novel \cosmoglobe\ DR1 synchrotron model is both more sensitive and systematically cleaner than similar previous models, and it has a more complete error description that is defined by a set of Monte Carlo posterior samples. We believe that these products are preferable for all synchrotron-related scientific applications, including simulation, forecasting and component separation.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Understanding the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a primary focus of observational cosmology in the coming decades. Following the success of the satellite-based COBE, \WMAP, and \Planck\ experiments, as well as the sub-orbital experiments including, e.g., BICEP, ACT, SPT, Polarbear, and many others, the future LiteBIRD satellite and ground-based Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 experiments will create the most sensitive maps of the polarized sky yet, providing the most stringent constraints on primordial gravitational waves.

In the past decade, uncertainty on cosmological constraints has been limited not only by instrumental sensitivity, but by incomplete knowledge of the sky itself. These analysis difficulties have been mitigated by analyzing maps from different experiments, e.g., \citet{pb2015}, or designing of experiments with broad frequency coverage, such as \WMAP\ \citep{bennett2012} and \Planck\ \citet{planck2016-l01}. A major impediment to joint analyses is the difficulty of combining data with different survey strategies and incompletely characterized systematics. In order to maximize scientific throughput, one must either design an experiment that can characterize every relevant observable on its own, or jointly analyze different datasets in the same joint framework.

The \bp\ project achieved this joint analyis by combining external data, i.e., the Haslam 408\,MHz map \citep{haslam1982}, \WMAP\ \Ka--\V\ bands, \Planck\ 353\,GHz in polarization, and \Planck\ 857\,GHz in intensity, while analyzing the \Planck\ 30, 44, and 70 GHz TOD \citep{bp01}.
The \Planck\ LFI experiment showed that raw detector sensitivity was not enough to obtain high-fidelity sky maps; \citet{planck2016-l02} found that the detector gain solution depended on the assumed polarization and intensity of the sky. To break this circular dependency, the \bp\ framework solved for the intrinsic sky signal and instrumental parameters iteratively, providing an accurate model of the entire system with full error propagation. By leveraging external data, \bp\ was able to create \Planck\ LFI of cosmological quality, while generating a robust model of the foreground sky.

In \cosmoglobe\ DR1 \citep{watts2023_dr1}, this end-to-end framework was extended, performing a joint analysis of the same data as \bp\ while adding the full \WMAP\ time-ordered data. This analysis not only improved the quality of the \WMAP\ maps themselves, but provided the most robust full-sky model of low frequency polarized emission available to date.

In order to make use of the synchrotron model, we require robust estimates of the spectral behavior. Fundamental behaviors, such as the spectral index as a function of frequency, spatial decorrelation, and even the functional form of the SED, are yet to be fully characterized observationally. Modern attempts have been stymied by the lack of high signal-to-noise data; \citet{deBelsunce:2022}, for example, find spectral indices ranging from $-5$ to $-1$, well outside of the theoretical limits of (?), given in, e.g., (?). This discrepancy is largely due to inadequate data coverage, requiring higher signal-to-noise datasets that have not yet been generated. Therefore, any conclusions about the distribution of the polarized synchrotron spectral index must be verified through multiple independent analysis methods and data choices.


In this work, we will use the \WMAP\ and LFI maps generated in the \cosmoglobe\ DR1 analysis. We perform three separate analyses; a linear correlation within regions (T-T plots), angular power spectra, and per-pixel Gibbs sampling.

For the power spectra, compare with, e.g., Figure 33 of \citet{planck2016-l04}. We use the same bins as in Table C.1 of \citet{planck2016-l11A}




\section{Data products}
\label{sec:data}

In this paper, we investigate the spatial variation of the polarized synchrotron spectral index, with an emphasis on the comparison between  legacy maps against the \cosmoglobe\ results. The data products used are the \WMAP\ and \Planck\ LFI maps, with most of the statistical weight coming from 23--33\,GHz. These frequencies are low enough that we can treat them as synchrotron tracers and hence ignore thermal dust and CMB, but not so low as we need to take into account effects like Faraday rotation \citep{fuskeland:2019}. The legacy data products and the data products from the \cosmoglobe\ \WMAP\ reanalysis \citep{watts2023_dr1}, are described in the two following sections.


\subsection{WMAP and Planck legacy data products}
\label{sec:wmap_data}

The \textit{Wilkinson Microwave Anistropy Probe} \citep[\WMAP]{bennett2012} was a NASA-funded satellite mission that observed from August 2001 to August 2010, designed to characterize the microwave sky well enough to measure the primary CMB anisotropies across the full sky down to a resolution of 13\arcm. Using a differential scanning strategy inspired by \COBE/DMR,
\WMAP\ produced maps of the sky at 23 (\K), 33 (\Ka), 41 (\Q), 61 (\V), and 94\,GHz (\W) in both polarization and intensity \citep{bennett2012}, with angular resolutions of 53\arcm\ at 23\,GHz to 13\arcm\ at 94\,\GHz. 
The maps are available on the LAMBDA website.\footnote{\url{https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/wmap/dr5/m_products.html}} 

The \Planck\ Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) produced  30, 44, and 70 GHz maps in both intensity and polarization, while the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) produced 100, 143, 217, 353\,GHz maps in polarization and intensity, and 545 and 857\,GHz maps in intensity alone. The LFI data in particular are similar to the \WMAP\ data, with higher angular resolutions of 30\arcm, 20\arcm, and 13\arcm\ for 30, 44, and 70 GHz, and with higher sensitivity. Although the detector design was similar, LFI observed with a single horn, and observed in rings closely aligned with the ecliptic longitude. The legacy datasets, PR3 \citep{planck2016-l01} and PR4 \citep{planck2020-LVII}, are both publicly available on the \Planck\ Legacy Archive (PLA).\footnote{\url{https://pla.esac.esa.int/}}

\subsection{The Cosmoglobe data products}
\label{sec:cosmoglobe_data}

The goal of \Cosmoglobe\ is to perform joint end-to-end analyses on several data sets jointly, preferably beginning from raw time-ordered data (TOD). Doing this can help to break the degeneracies of the different data sets, and in general reduced the amplitude of systematic effects. The analysis performed in \citet{bp01} and \citet{watts2023_dr1} was performed on raw TOD to cosmological parameters using the Bayesian Gibbs sampler, \commanderthree. The data products produced in these analysis account for the complex interactions between the instrument, the microwave sky, and its consistutent components self-consistnetly.

The analysis in this paper makes use of \cosmoglobe\ end products produced by the reanalysis of the \WMAP\ and \Planck\ LFI TODs \citep{watts2023_dr1}. This analysis produced improved \WMAP\ and \Planck\ LFI maps, which we will use in an analysis to compare to the legacy data. In particular, we are interested in exactly the same set of maps as in the previous section in order to be able to do a comparision study. The pixelization and angular scale are the same as for the legacy products ($N_\textrm{side}=64$, $1^\circ$ FWHM). The \cosmoglobe\ end products consists of a series of 500 samples from the Gibbs chain, instead of just one mean sample as has been the normal case for previous data releases.

\begin{figure*}

	\caption{
		Improvement of synchrotron polarization amplitude $P=\sqrt{Q^2+U^2}$.
		}
       \label{fig:synch_polint}
\end{figure*}

While the \cosmoglobe\ pipeline produces samples of polarized synchrotron emission, the spatial variation of the spectral index is poorly determined within the Gibbs chain. To mitigate the poor MCMC convergence of the spectral indices, the \cosmoglobe\ DR1 sampled the spectral index from a prior distribution, $\beta_s\sim\mathcal N(-3.15, 0.05^2)$. Improvements within the \commanderthree\ framework will require more high signal-to-noise data and algorithmic improvements within the codebase.


The polarized spectral amplitude determined from \cosmoglobe\ compares favorably to previous estimates using \WMAP\ and \Planck\ LFI data, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:synch_polint}. We plot the total polarized amplitude $P=\sqrt{Q^2+U^2}$ for ease of comparison, although it creates a visible noise bias in the low amplitude regions. Each of these maps were produced with slightly different pipelines and datasets. The top row shows \Planck\ PR4 and \WMAPnine, and consists of entirely different datasets.\footnote{\textbf{Perhaps several samples of \WMAP-only would be useful to compare apples-to-apples, since these are all \commanderthree\ products.}} The synchrotron solution is driven by the lowest frequency map, 30\,GHz and \K-band respectively, so any difference in the amplitude maps are due to differences in a combination of data processing, instrumental properties, and the microwave sky at 23\,GHz and 30\,GHz.

The synchrotron amplitude maps from end-to-end processing, \bp\ and \cosmoglobe, contain slightly different datasets, but sample the instrumental properties and sky properties jointly. Of these maps, \bp\ has lower resolution and higher noise, in large part because \cosmoglobe\ is able to use the reprocessed \WMAP\ \K-band map.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/polint_CG_sigma.pdf}

	\caption{

		\textit{(Bottom:)} \cosmoglobe\ posterior standard deviation divided by \bp\ posterior standard deviation. The ratio is less than one for all pixels.
		}
		\label{fig:rms_ratios}
\end{figure}


The \cosmoglobe\ synchrotron map has a mean posterior rms of $2.4\,\mathrm{\mu K}$, a marked improvement over the \bp\ map, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rms_ratios}. The rms map itself contains high signal-to-noise regions corresponding to the \WMAP\ circles about the ecliptic poles as well as the \Planck\ rings and multiple ecliptic polar crossings. The main clear astrophysical variation comes in the forms of a thin region about the Galactic plane and several low-latitude point sources. Much of the improvement can be seen more clearly when taking the ratio of the posterior rms's, as in the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:rms_ratios}. As expected, the regions with the lowest ratios correspond to the deep \WMAP\ observations and the Galactic plane, which benefit from the high signal-to-noise of the \K-band data. Regions with nearly identical rms include regions with the highest \Planck\ depth, i.e., the ecliptic poles, and regions less deeply observed by \WMAP, corresponding to planet crossings and artifacts from the processing mask. Notably, stripes corresponding the \Planck\ scan strategy also show improvement respect to \bp. This is due to the interaction between the sky model and LFI's instrumental parameters -- with the high signal-to-noise \K-band data, the sky model becomes more stable, and LFI's relative gain solution becomes better determined.



\section{TT-plot method}
\label{sec:methods}



\begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/utnymaske_tall_converted.pdf}
        \caption{The sky is split into the same 24 regions as in \citet{fuskeland2014}. The most prominent point sources are masked out and shown as the grey circular areas.
        }
        \label{fig:regions}
\end{figure}


Following \citet{fuskeland2014} and \citet{fuskeland:2019}, we apply linear regression via the T-T (``temperature-temperature'') method, in which spectral indices can be estimated over extended regions with approxiately constant spectral indices. In this approach, our data model for two frequencies is
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol m_\nu = \boldsymbol m_{\nu_0}\left(\frac\nu{\nu_0}\right)^\beta+o_\nu+\boldsymbol n_\nu ,
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol m_\nu$ is a spatially varying amplitude map, $\nu_0$ is the reference frequency, $\beta$ the power law between hte two frequencies, $o_\nu$ the spatially constant offset per band, and $\boldsymbol n_\nu$ the noise.  In the case of noiseleless data with no offset, the spectral index may be estimated using a simple ratio,
\begin{equation}
	\frac{m_{\nu_1,p}}{m_{\nu_2,p}}
	=\left(\frac{\nu_1}{\nu_2}\right)^{\beta_{s,p}}
	\Rightarrow
	\beta_{s,p}=\frac{\ln(m_{\nu_1,p}/m_{\nu_2,p})}{\ln(\nu_1/\nu_2)}
\end{equation}
The standard T-T plot method computes performs a linear regression $\boldsymbol m_{\nu_1}=a\boldsymbol m_{\nu_2}+b$, and associates $\beta_s$ with $\ln a/\ln(\nu_1/\nu_2)$. More care must be taken when the noise amplitudes in both maps are comparable, so we adopt the effective variance method of \citet{orear192} as implemented by \citet{fuskeland2014}.

For the T-T plot  analysis, we focus exclusively on bands between 23 and 33\,GHz. As in \citet{fuskeland2014}, we use the \WMAP\ K and Ka band Stokes $Q$ and $U$ parameter maps at $23$\,GHz and $33$\,GHz. The respective effective frequencies used are $22.45$\,GHz and $32.64$\,GHz. The maps originally at a HealPIX pixelization of $N_\textrm{side}=512$ are downgraded to $N_\textrm{side}=64$ and smoothed to a common resolution of $1^\circ$ FWHM.
The \Planck\ data products used are the Ka band Stokes $Q$ and $U$ maps at $30$\,GHz. We use an effective frequency of $28.4$\,GHz.  The products are natively at $N_\textrm{side}=1024$, but as for the \WMAP\ products, the maps are downgraded to $N_\textrm{side}=64$ and smoothed to $1\circ$ FWHM.

Much better propagation of uncertainties with a whole suite of maps.

        \label{fig:cos20_beta_map}
\end{figure}

The uncertainty is calculated as the minimum of the uncertainties in each rotation angle, and region. As in the Fuskeland 2021 paper, an systematic uncertainty that takes into account the variation of beta over rotation angle; $[ \max(\beta_\alpha) - \min(\beta_\alpha) ] /2$ is added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty.
For the Cosmoglobe analyses the standard deviation of the spectral indices for all samples is also added in quadrature to represent an additional systematic uncertainty.
